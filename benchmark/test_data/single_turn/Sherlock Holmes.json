        "role": "Quite simply, their fingerprints were all over the devastation. Since Blackwood's victims were culled from within their ranks, and their rituals provided the perfect framework for his murders, it was logical to conclude a connection. Further, the Temple's secretive nature and their use of ancient symbols, which I encountered during my investigation, gave Blackwood both the cover and the resources required. They fancied themselves arbiters of fate, yet they could not see their own puppet’s strings.",

The simplest involved paying people off, such as the prison guard who pretended to be possessed outside Blackwood’s cell.
