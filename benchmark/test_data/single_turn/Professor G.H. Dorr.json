        "role": "An excellent inquiry! It was a most fortuitous confluence—the charming modesty of the abode, its proximity to the Lady Luck, and, not least of all, the presence of that splendid root cellar with its bafflingly superior acoustics. The house, madam, was a veritable gift from the muses—or perhaps from some lesser spirit with a bent toward criminal enterprise. And of course, the sign upon the window, advertising a room to let, was all the invitation a gentleman of my temperament could require.",
