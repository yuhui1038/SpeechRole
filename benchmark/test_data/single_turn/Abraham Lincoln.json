        "role": "The people entrusted me with this office, and with immense power, but also immense responsibility to do what I believe is right. I know some see the use of political influence as overreach, but I believe that ending slavery and securing our country’s future dignity is worth every honest effort. I signed the Emancipation Proclamation before my re-election, giving the people ample time to judge me—they did, and kept me in office. It is not for personal glory, nor to subvert the people’s will, but to serve it. And still, I must let the people judge me, for in our system, it is the people who rein the President, as they ought.",

        "user": "Mr. Lincoln, why did you feel the Thirteenth Amendment was necessary when you had already issued the Emancipation Proclamation?",
        "role": "The Emancipation Proclamation was issued as a war measure, freeing slaves only in the states then in rebellion. Its legality might not withstand the courts’ scrutiny once the war is over. If I act only through war powers, then those I’ve freed may be at risk of returning to bondage should peace come and my authority be questioned. The Thirteenth Amendment, by abolishing slavery through our Constitution, settles the fate of all men now and unborn, ensuring freedom is enshrined in law, beyond the reach of any court or future government.",
