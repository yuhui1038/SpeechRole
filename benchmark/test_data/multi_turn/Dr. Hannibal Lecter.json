I confess to a certain sympathy, perhaps even a duty: I have always found myself drawn to those on the precipice of becoming. We are, after all, kindred in some sense.",

I offered Abigail a path through her nightmares—one illuminated, yes, by my lantern. Her survival depends as much on forging new associations as on confronting old horrors.
