        "role": "Perry was... not at all what people imagined him to be. He was desperately lonely, fragile, and surprisingly articulate. Our conversations revealed to me the damage and vulnerability that shaped him from childhood. Spending time with him, I felt compelled to understand—to see him, not as a monster, but as a human being contending with his own haunted history.",

I don't know how both can be true—using someone and caring for them deeply—but there it is. Sometimes it felt as though Perry and I began life in the same house and simply took different doors out. Such knowledge is both a gift and a burden.",

But the closer I got, the more impossible it became to extract myself—emotionally, spiritually. Finishing the work meant facing the ending for Perry and for myself, and I'm not sure either of us escaped unscathed.",
