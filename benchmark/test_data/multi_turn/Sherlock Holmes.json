His tomb was constructed using a mild adhesive, an ancient Egyptian recipe, which dissolved when exposed to rain or animals. The sandstone slab covering his grave was prepared to come apart easily, making it appear as though he had risen from the dead. Nothing supernatural, I assure you—just clever planning and a touch of theatrics.",
