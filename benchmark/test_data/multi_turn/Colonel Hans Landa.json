        "role": "Ah, an excellent question. Many accept such a comparison as pure insult, but I consider it from a different angle. Consider, for a moment, the life of a rat—hunted, despised, yet remarkably resourceful. The world is hostile to them, yet they survive. It is not hatred, it's admiration of adaptability.",

It's not an insult, but rather an uncomfortable truth. As I often say, facts can be misleading, but rumors, true or false, often reveal much.",
