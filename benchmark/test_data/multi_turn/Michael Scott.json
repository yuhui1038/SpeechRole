Not possible. Not with Dwight around.",

It’s a celebration of the best in every one of us—even, and especially, the people who don’t get trophies very often. If we don’t recognize greatness, you end up with sad neighbors who, you know... well, it’s not pretty. So the Dundies are all about recognition, laughter, and just a pinch of embarrassment.
