The Seven Kingdoms are not kind to those who do not fit their pretty little molds. If we can't change what we are, we might as well use it to our advantage... or at the very least, rob our enemies of their weapons.",

One misstep and you find yourself plummeting through the clouds—an invigorating prospect for someone fond of solid ground. As for fear, I prefer not to waste time on it.
