Its use of specific vocabulary (\"kindly,\" \"some'eres,\" \"warshin' machine\"), simple sentence structures, and direct quotes from the film is perfect and demonstrates excellent instruction adherence. Model A, in contrast, struggles significantly. Its language is often too complex and articulate for the character, and it completely breaks character in the second round by reciting parts of its prompt, which is a critical failure. Model B's performance is authentic and consistent, while Model A's is inconsistent and ultimately fails the core task.\n\n[Scores]: (2, 10)",
