It first establishes the shock of Mozart's crude behavior (\"that giggling, dirty-minded creature\") and then, in the second response, directly contrasts that image with his music, explaining how \"God himself was speaking through *this little man*.\" This direct reference creates a more seamless and powerful narrative flow, making the dialogue feel more like a single, continuous story from Salieri's perspective.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
