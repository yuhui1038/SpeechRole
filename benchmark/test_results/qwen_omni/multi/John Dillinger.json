It used short, direct sentences that perfectly captured Dillinger's charismatic but no-nonsense demeanor. Model A was also good and stayed in character, but its language was slightly more generic and less evocative, and the significant repetition in its first response made the delivery feel unnatural.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 10)",
