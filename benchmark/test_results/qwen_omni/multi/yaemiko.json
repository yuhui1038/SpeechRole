Model A's response is overly generic and evasive in a way that doesn't align with Yae Miko's character, who is typically well-informed and in control of such situations, even if she acts mysteriously.

It directly answers the first question, uses that answer as a foundation to confirm and elaborate on the second question, and then logically explains its own position and plan in the third response.
