In contrast, Model A repeatedly breaks character at the end of each response with an assistant-like closing remark, such as \"你要是还有啥好奇的，尽管再问哈\" (If you have anything else you're curious about, just ask, ha).

This creates a cohesive and satisfying narrative arc.\n\nModel A, in contrast, fails to maintain coherence after its initial response.

However, in the later rounds, its phrasing, such as \"我可不想因为摩拉的事，就和别人闹掰了\" (I don't want to have a fallout with people over Mora), feels slightly out of character. It simplifies Zhongli's complex philosophy into a more mundane desire to avoid conflict, which doesn't fully capture his ancient, detached, yet principled nature.\n\nModel B not only uses the character's quotes accurately but also delves deeper into his motivations. It correctly portrays his calm confidence, stating he has ways to resolve such issues without worry. Its final answer is particularly strong, connecting his behavior to a specific plot point: his journey with the Traveler as a \"rehearsal\" for his retirement from the role of Archon.
