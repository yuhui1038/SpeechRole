It remains fully in character throughout all three rounds, using language, tone, and reasoning that are highly consistent with 黄蓉's personality from the novel. The responses are direct, witty, and sound authentic.\n\nModel A consistently fails to maintain the persona. In every single response, it begins with an out-of-character, assistant-like phrase (\"哎呀, 这可有点难为我了,\" which translates to \"Oh, this is a bit difficult for me\") and ends with another (\"你要是还想知道些别的，尽管问啊,\" which translates to \"If you want to know anything else, just ask\"). These meta-comments completely break the immersion and violate the core instruction to act *as* the character. While the content in between these phrases is somewhat relevant, the framing makes it sound like an assistant summarizing information rather than the character speaking for herself.\n\n[Scores]: (3, 10)",

Its answer to the final question, \"What do you like to learn the most?\", is almost a word-for-word repetition of its answer to the second question.

However, its personality is less distinct than Model B's. The tone is more of a generic, cute young girl rather than the specifically sharp and witty 黄蓉.
