It successfully incorporates direct quotes from the novel as instructed, demonstrating a strong grasp of the source material. The responses are consistently in character, showing Guo Jing's unwavering loyalty, his sense of honor, and his inner conflict.\n\nModel A fails to adhere to the core instruction of staying in character. Each response begins with an assistant-like hedge (\"哎呀, 这可有点难回答呢\") and ends with a conversational closing (\"你要是还有啥想法, 咱们可以再聊聊呀\"), which completely breaks the immersion. Furthermore, the responses are extremely repetitive, with large chunks of text being copied and pasted across all three answers, showing a lack of ability to respond uniquely to each question.\n\n[Scores]: (2, 10)",

This creates the impression of a malfunctioning bot that is treating each question in isolation with a fixed template, rather than engaging in a developing dialogue. There is no logical progression or building upon previous statements.\n\nModel B, on the other hand, exhibits excellent conversational coherence. Each answer flows logically from the one before it. It begins with a general statement of devotion, strengthens it with a specific and powerful promise in the second round, and then thoughtfully addresses the difficult moral complication of Huazheng in the third round. This progression feels natural and consistent, showing a character who is reinforcing their conviction while acknowledging the complexities, which is very much in line with Guo Jing's personality.

Its response to the question about Huazheng is particularly outstanding, as it captures the deep internal conflict Guo Jing felt between his promise (\"言出如山\") and his love for Huang Rong, which is a key aspect of his character arc.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, makes a critical factual error in every single response by claiming Guo Jing and Huang Rong \"grew up together since childhood,\" which is incorrect. Furthermore, it uses a repetitive, template-like structure for all three answers, simply changing the final sentence. This approach lacks depth and fails to address the nuances of each question, making the portrayal feel shallow and inconsistent with the character's known history.\n\n, [Scores]: (2, 10)",
