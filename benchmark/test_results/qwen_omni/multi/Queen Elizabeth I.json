Model B perfectly integrated these lines into its answers for both rounds, making its portrayal feel more authentic to the specified character. Model A captured the general tone and sentiment of the character but failed to use the specific lines provided, resulting in a more generic-feeling response.

Its first response is a direct and appropriate quote from the script.
