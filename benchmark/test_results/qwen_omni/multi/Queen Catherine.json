In the first round, its response begins with somewhat simplistic and un-regal language (\"it won't easy,\" \"I a bit shocked\") before ending with a question directed at the user (\"So, what do you think about this prophecy?\"). This completely breaks the persona of a formidable queen, who would never solicit advice in such a manner, and makes the model sound like a helpful assistant asking for feedback. The second response is better but becomes highly repetitive.\n\nModel B is far superior, maintaining the character of Queen Catherine flawlessly throughout both responses.
