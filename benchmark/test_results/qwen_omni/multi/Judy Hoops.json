Both successfully integrated key plot points and the specific line \"It's called a hustle, sweetheart\" into their answers, making the role-play feel authentic and well-informed. The vocal performances were also excellent, capturing Judy's energetic and earnest nature.

The second answer feels like a separate, simplistic statement rather than a thoughtful continuation of the first. It states that working with Nick was a positive experience but doesn't connect it back to the transactional and mistrustful beginning described in the first response, making the transition feel abrupt and lacking the depth of a coherent character journey.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 5)",

The delivery is significantly calmer and more measured, lacking the signature peppy energy and dynamic pitch variation of Judy Hopps. The prosody feels more like a generic friendly narrator than the specific, high-energy bunny cop from the film.
