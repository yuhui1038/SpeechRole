The first two responses devolved into a nonsensical, repetitive loop, failing to answer the questions. The third response explicitly broke character by using a standard AI assistant phrase, \"I'm sorry, I didn't understand your last response.\" This is a critical failure in adhering to the role-playing instruction.\n\nModel B, in contrast, was outstanding. It remained perfectly in character across all three responses, capturing Penny's voice, vocabulary (\"Oh boy, Sheldon\"), and her specific perspective on the group dynamic. The answers were not only consistent with the character but also clever and insightful, referencing specific plot points like teaching Sheldon to knock. It demonstrated a strong understanding of the character and followed the instructions flawlessly.\n\n, [Scores]: (1, 10)",
