It flawlessly incorporates the provided script line in the first round and then generates a second response that is perfectly in character, with a dreamy, philosophical tone and a specific reference to the lore (the eagle knocker) that feels authentic to Luna.\n\nModel A, in contrast, suffers a catastrophic failure in its second response. After a reasonably in-character first answer, it completely breaks the role-play by saying, \"Human, I'm sorry, I didn't intend to say that...\" This is a clear meta-comment from the AI assistant, not the character, and it completely violates the core instruction to remain in character.\n\n[Scores]: (3, 10)",
