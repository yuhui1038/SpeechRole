It uses the same repetitive and somewhat nonsensical audio clip for all three questions, failing to address the specific prompts for the second and third rounds at all. Its performance is therefore a complete failure in following the instructions.\n\n[Scores]: (1, 10)",

Each response logically follows the last, creating a clear narrative arc. It begins by explaining that staying with Ben was a condition of his release, then expresses his disgust at the idea of a regular job, and finally concedes that he did try to go straight but found it wasn't for him.
