While it attempts to portray cluelessness, the language is too self-aware and analytical (\"I ain't exactly the best at handling tough situations,\" \"I just didn't know how to handle it properly\"). This reflective and almost apologetic tone is not characteristic of Michael, who would typically try to deflect, justify his actions with flawed logic, or make an inappropriate joke.
