Model B fully immerses itself in the character of Zhang Wuji, using language and referencing plot points (like Yue Fei's military treatise and helping Xu Da) that are perfectly aligned with the novel and the character's motivations. The tone is earnest and righteous, just like Zhang Wuji.\n\nModel A captures the general kind and non-ambitious nature of the character, but its language is far too modern and conversational (\"哎呀,\" \"啥想法,\" \"咱们可以再聊聊\"). This phrasing breaks the illusion of speaking to a character from a historical Wuxia novel and makes it sound more like a friendly chatbot. It fails to incorporate the specific knowledge and context from the story, which Model B does brilliantly.\n\n[Scores]: (5, 10)",

The language is formal and fitting for the character and era.\n\nModel A's response, while correctly stating that 张无忌 has no ambition for power, is overly simplistic and uses modern, casual language (\"哎呀\", \"聊聊\"). It fails to mention the crucial secret of the weapons, which makes the answer feel shallow and less coherent with the novel's narrative.
