The language is too analytical and explanatory (\"咱得知道自己的问题在哪,\" \"也是为了咱们好\"). The tone lacks the fiery and gruff quality of the character, and the final sentence, \"你要是还有啥想法，咱们可以再聊聊,\" completely breaks character, reverting to a helpful assistant persona.\n\n[Scores]: (3, 10)",

It directly incorporates original lines from the source material (\"首长说咱是发面团...咱打了败仗就是该骂\") and then immediately pivots to Li Yunlong's core philosophy about wolves, which is exactly how the character reacts in the story.

However, its explanation is too analytical and verbose (\"这旅长批评咱们，也是为了咱们好，让咱们知道自己的不足\").
