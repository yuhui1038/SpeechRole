It correctly references the passing of her parents and how she shares the burden with her brother, Ayato (\"我与兄长一同承担\"), which is a direct reflection of the provided character script and in-game story.\n- It correctly alludes to the duties of the Yashiro Commission (\"祭祀家族事宜\" - matters of clan rituals).\n- The expression of pressure is tied directly to her core motivation: the stability of Inazuma and the well-being of her clan (\"令稻妻安稳，家门无恙\"). This demonstrates a strong understanding of her character's deep-seated sense of duty.\n- The response shows excellent knowledge consistency by incorporating key elements of her backstory and motivations.\n\n**Qualitative Evaluation & Scoring:**\nModel B's response is far more consistent with Ayaka's established knowledge and background. It specifically references her parents' death and her brother, directly aligning with her known history. Model A provides a generic answer that could apply to any noble lady, failing to incorporate the specific details that define Ayaka's situation and responsibilities.\n\n[Qualitative Evaluation]: Model B demonstrates superior knowledge consistency by accurately incorporating key elements from Ayaka's backstory, such as the passing of her parents and sharing responsibilities with her brother. Its answer is specific and grounded in the character's lore. Model A's response is generic and lacks specific details, making it less convincing and consistent with the established knowledge of the character.\n[Scores]: (4, 10)",
