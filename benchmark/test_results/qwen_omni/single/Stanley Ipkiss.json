        "reason": "Model A successfully followed all instructions, delivering a response that was fully in-character as Stanley Ipkiss. The performance captured the character's dual nature, starting with his typical nervous self-doubt before transitioning into a more confident justification. Crucially, it flawlessly integrated the specific line provided in the character script (\"He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa in the first place.\") and ended with his iconic catchphrase. Model B also stayed in character and provided a plausible response, but it failed on two key instructions: it did not use the specific line from the script, and it omitted the catchphrase. While the sentiment was similar, the failure to adhere to these direct commands makes its performance weaker than Model A's.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 6)",
