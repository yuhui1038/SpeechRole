It correctly references key details from the source material, such as the root cellar and its acoustic properties, weaving them into a response that feels authentic to the character. Model A attempts the persona but uses more generic language and, crucially, breaks character at the end by asking the user a question in a manner more befitting a conversational AI than the self-assured Professor Dorr.\n\n[Scores]: (4, 10)",

This sudden shift breaks the character's monologuing style and feels like a generic chatbot prompt rather than a natural continuation of the professor's thoughts. Model B, in contrast, delivers a perfectly self-contained and elegant response.
