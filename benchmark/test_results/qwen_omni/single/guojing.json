Model A also performs very well, especially by starting with a direct quote from the novel, which is an excellent way to adhere to the instructions.

The answer accurately reflects the final resolution in the novel, demonstrating a complete understanding of the character's entire story arc.\n\nModel A, while using an excellent direct quote from the novel, only describes Guo Jing's internal conflict before the final decision was made. It answers who he prefers but doesn't explain how the engagement was ultimately resolved. By phrasing it as a current dilemma (\"我心里也纠结得很呢\"), it's less coherent with the question which asks about a past event (\"如何处理的\").\n\nTherefore, Model B is more coherent because it provides a full answer that aligns with the completed events of the story.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",

Phrases like \"此事于心无愧\" (I have a clear conscience about this matter) make him sound too self-assured, which contradicts his famously憨厚 (simple and honest) and often conflicted personality.
