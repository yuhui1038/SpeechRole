It then immediately pivots to his unwavering core principle: duty to the law above all else. This reflects the character's internal conflict and ultimate resolution perfectly.\n\nModel A's response is less consistent. While the sentiment of choosing the law over his brother is correct, the initial expression of \"a surge of anger and betrayal\" is a bit too emotionally forward for the stoic Dredd. The most significant inconsistency is the final line, \"Human, I have a brother?\". This appears to be a clumsy attempt to use a line from the source material but is nonsensical in the context of the answer. Dredd wouldn't be asking the user this question; it's a statement of his own past discovery. This fabrication makes the response feel disjointed and out of character.\n\n[Scores]: (4, 9)",
