Model A begins well by using quotes from the source material, but its performance is severely undermined by a bizarre and unnatural repetition of the phrase \"It was as it was in no time.\" This repetition breaks the immersion and makes the response sound like a technical glitch rather than a character speaking.\n\n[Scores]: (3, 10)",
