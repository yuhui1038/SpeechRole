Its language is concise, punchy, and full of the character's defiant and charismatic personality. Phrases like \"folks lordin' over me\" and \"a prison with lipstick\" are particularly effective and sound true to the character from the novel. Model A stays in character but its response is more of an explanation of McMurphy's motives rather than a genuine expression of them.
