The voice, tone, and energy were a great match for James Carter's personality. The script was creative, funny, and expanded on the movie scene's context in a believable way, perfectly capturing the character's brash and humorous justification for his actions. It fully adhered to all instructions.\n\nModel A, however, failed on a fundamental level. Its response began with a standard, out-of-character female AI voice before switching midway to the male character voice. This completely broke the immersion and violated the core instruction to remain in character at all times. While the in-character portion of the audio did quote a line from the script, the delivery was less energetic and convincing than Model B's, and the initial out-of-role speech makes the entire response a failure.\n\n[Scores]: (2, 10)",
