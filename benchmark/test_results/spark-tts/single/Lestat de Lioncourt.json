The phrasing and vocabulary used in Model B's response—\"Control? Such a mortal word\"—is a perfect encapsulation of Lestat's disdainful arrogance and ancient perspective. Model A's performance was good, but the voice felt a bit more generic and less distinctive than Model B's portrayal.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
