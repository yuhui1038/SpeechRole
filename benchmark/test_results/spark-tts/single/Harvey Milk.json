They stayed completely in the persona of Harvey Milk without any out-of-role meta-commentary.\n\nModel A was particularly effective at weaving the provided script lines into its answer, creating a response that felt both natural and authentic to the film's dialogue. The delivery was passionate and speech-like, perfectly capturing Harvey's public persona. Model B also did a fantastic job, using one of the provided lines and another famous Harvey Milk quote (\"You gotta give 'em hope\"). The phrasing \"kicking the damn door down\" was a great, character-appropriate addition. While both were superb, Model A's seamless integration of both specific lines from the provided context gave it a slight edge in following the instructions to the letter.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

It captured the spirit of Harvey Milk's motivation, focusing on the idea that running for office, even in a loss, was about building a movement and giving hope. The logic was sound and consistent with the character.
