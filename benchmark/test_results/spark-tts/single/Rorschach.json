It built a logical argument from Rorschach's perspective: others ignore the filth, but he cannot because \"Justice matters.\" The flow was coherent and powerful.\n\nModel B was equally strong, also starting with the idea of retirement as \"surrender.\" It incorporated a direct, iconic quote from Rorschach's journal (\"I've seen the city's true face...\"), which grounded the response firmly in the source material. The analogy of his work as a \"war\" you don't retire from was a particularly effective and coherent conclusion.\n\nBoth models demonstrated flawless conversational coherence, providing answers that were logically structured, internally consistent, and perfectly aligned with the character's established motivations.

It lacks the essential grit, rasp, and vocal fry that defines Rorschach's voice.
