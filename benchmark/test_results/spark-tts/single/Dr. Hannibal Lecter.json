The language is sophisticated and evasive, maintaining the logical consistency of his character without contradiction.\n\nModel B, in contrast, demonstrates poor conversational coherence. The response introduces concepts like \"duty\" and empathy (\"everyone deserves a warning\"), which are fundamentally contradictory to Dr. Lecter's amoral and psychopathic nature.
