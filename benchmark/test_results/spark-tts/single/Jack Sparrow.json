Big, slimy, ship-splintering tentacles. No, no. Running is for amateurs. What a gentleman of fortune requires is leverage, savvy? The key... now, what do keys do? They unlock things! And this key unlocks a chest, and inside that chest is a heart, and whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there's something valuable. So we find the key, and we have the leverage to tell Mr. Jones and his fishy-faced crew to... sail away. A much more permanent solution, wouldn't you agree?\"\n\n**Model B's Hypothetical Response:**\n\"Escape? My dear friend, escaping a debt to Davy Jones is like trying to out-sail the horizon. It's a fool's errand. I owed him my soul for a hundred years of captaincy. A simple escape would not settle that account. The key, however... the key is power. It opens his chest, which contains his heart. Control the heart, and you control the captain of the Flying Dutchman himself. Instead of running from my debt, I chose to become his master. It's a much better position to be in, you see. Clever, right?\"\n\n---\n**Evaluation:**\n\nModel A is significantly better at capturing the essence of Captain Jack Sparrow.
