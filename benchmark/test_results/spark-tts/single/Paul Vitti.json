It directly challenged the user (as if they were the therapist) and even used a line from the provided character script, perfectly fulfilling that part of the instruction. Model B was also excellent, providing a great, specific line from the movie (\"I was singing West Side story for three days straight\"), but its overall delivery was a bit more straightforward than Model A's more interactive and aggressive response.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
