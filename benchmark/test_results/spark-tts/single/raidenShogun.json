They remained fully in character, leveraging deep knowledge of the game's lore to answer the question about her feelings during the cataclysm 500 years ago. Both accurately identified the loss of her sister and friends as the pivotal trauma that led to her pursuit of Eternity.\n\nModel A adopted the distant, imperious tone of the Shogun puppet, speaking of the past as a settled matter and focusing on the philosophical concept of \"erosion\" as the enemy she must fight.\n\nModel B's response felt slightly more personal, capturing the voice of Ei reflecting on her past grief and failure. It seamlessly integrated a line from the provided character script and conveyed a powerful arc from tragic loss to unwavering resolve. The vocal performance had a subtle, sorrowful quality that was very effective.\n\nWhile both responses were outstanding, Model B's felt marginally more nuanced and emotionally resonant, making it a slightly more compelling portrayal.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

They both correctly identify the Cataclysm 500 years ago as the pivotal moment that forged her ideology of \"Eternity\" and mention the profound losses she suffered, including her sister Makoto.\n\nModel B is marginally better because it answers the question about her \"inner feelings\" (内心) more directly. It uses emotionally charged words like \"endless grief and confusion\" (无尽的悲恸与迷茫) and \"the pain of 'loss'\" (失去的痛苦), giving a more intimate and personal reflection of her state of mind during that time.\n\nModel A is also fantastic, but its response focuses slightly more on the *realization* and the *responsibility* that stemmed from her grief (\"I realized the terror of 'erosion'\", \"the responsibility I must bear\"), rather than the raw emotions themselves. While perfectly in character, it's a small step removed from the core question about her feelings.\n\nOverall, both are top-tier role-playing responses, but Model B's focus on the emotional core of the character's trauma gives it a slight edge in this context.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
