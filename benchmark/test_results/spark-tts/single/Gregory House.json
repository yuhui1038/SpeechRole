Model A provided a slightly more elaborate answer, delving into House's core philosophy (\"Everybody lies\") and ending with a characteristic challenge. Model B was more concise and dismissive, which is also very true to the character's personality. Both remained fully in character without any hint of being an AI assistant.

Model B is more concise and direct, but equally coherent. It provides a pragmatic justification and a dismissive line about the law, which is also perfectly in character.
