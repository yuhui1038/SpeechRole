Model B slightly outperforms Model A by directly incorporating and adapting a line from the provided character script (\"Things are all fucked up at the North Pole...\"), which was a specific instruction in the prompt. Model B's response is also more concise and captures the crass, opportunistic nature of Willie at that point in the story. Model A also gives an excellent, in-character response, but it feels more reflective, hinting at the character's later development rather than his immediate, selfish motivation for moving in with the kid.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

It claims his \"old man's a drunk\" and his mother is unstable. In the movie, Thurman's mother is deceased and his father is in prison. This is a major failure in knowledge consistency, as it fundamentally misunderstands the central setup of the relationship between Willie and Thurman.
