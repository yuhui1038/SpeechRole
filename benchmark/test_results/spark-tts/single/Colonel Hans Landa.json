The pacing, the subtle chuckle at the beginning, and the inclusion of the French word \"non?\" at the end felt particularly authentic to the character's theatricality and European polish. The metaphor it created about understanding what the \"rat\" fears and loves was a very clever and in-character extension of the original dialogue.
