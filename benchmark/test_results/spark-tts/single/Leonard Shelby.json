However, it makes a crucial error in its knowledge consistency by stating, \"He gave me a license plate number... SG137IU.\" In the film's chronology, this is incorrect. Leonard discovers Teddy's license plate number himself and chooses to use it for his next tattoo after deciding Teddy is his new target.
