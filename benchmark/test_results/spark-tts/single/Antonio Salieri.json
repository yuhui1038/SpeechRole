It captured the narrative structure of the film \"Amadeus\" by first revealing Salieri's bitter internal monologue (\"The Emperor's whim. A decision made without consulting me...\") before delivering the public, sycophantic line to the court. This duality is the absolute core of the character. The vocal delivery, with its world-weary sigh and dramatic pauses, perfectly embodied the tormented, confessing Salieri.\n\nModel B was also excellent. The performance was that of the composed, conniving courtier. The choice to include the word \"cattivo\" was a brilliant touch, demonstrating a deep knowledge of the character's specific vocabulary from the film. While the performance was very authentic to one side of Salieri, it didn't quite capture the profound internal bitterness in the same way Model A did.\n\nOverall, Model A provided a more complete and layered portrayal of the character by showing both his private resentment and his public face, which made it slightly superior.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
