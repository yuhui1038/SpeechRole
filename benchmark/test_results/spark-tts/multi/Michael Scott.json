The creative extension of this idea in the second round (comparing his stapler to a stethoscope) is also very strong and consistent with his way of thinking.\n\nModel B also demonstrates excellent knowledge. It correctly identifies Jan as the one who gave the order and uses Michael's core motivation—that his employees are his family—as the reason for his actions.
