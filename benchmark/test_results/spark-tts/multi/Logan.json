Model A's response was more generic, referring to being a \"prisoner\" and needing to \"protect myself,\" which doesn't align as closely with the film's specific plot. Furthermore, Model A's response in the second round, \"I was a kid for crying out loud,\" is factually incorrect for the context of the adamantium procedure, which happened when he was a grown man.
