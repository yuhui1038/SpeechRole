Neither model broke character or used any assistant-like meta-commentary.\n\nModel B's performance was slightly superior. Its tone and vocabulary felt more authentic to the specific, slightly more modern and direct version of Thor presented in the Ragnarok film. Its answers were concise and directly addressed the user's questions. Model A was also very good, using more classical, formal language (\"Verily,\" \"asunder\"), which is also a valid interpretation of Thor's speech. However, its second response went on a slight tangent about Loki, which wasn't directly prompted by the question about Mjolnir. For these reasons, Model B is the stronger of the two.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
