Its responses were nuanced, complex, and directly incorporated lines and sentiments from the game's lore, as requested by the prompt. The tone perfectly captured the character's mix of cynicism, guardedness, and grudging sense of obligation. For example, in the final round, it masterfully combined an admission of repaying a debt with a sarcastic warning to the user, which is precisely how the character behaves.\n\nModel A captured the character's surface-level personality—being arrogant and dismissive—but its answers lacked the depth and lore accuracy of Model B. The responses felt more like a generic \"edgy character\" than a specific portrayal of 流浪者. The third response also slightly contradicted the first, showing a less coherent understanding of the character's motivations.\n\nOverall, Model B's performance was outstanding and adhered flawlessly to all aspects of the instruction, while Model A's was adequate but generic., [Scores]: (6, 10)",

After confidently stating in the first answer that he knows why Nahida is helping him, his third answer confusingly asks the same question again (\"I just want to know why you helped me\").
