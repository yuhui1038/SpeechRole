The actor captured the fast-talking, charismatic yet creepy energy of the character, making the dialogue feel more authentic and alive. The pacing and intonation were a near-perfect match for Bruno.\n\nModel B's script was also excellent and very much in character, even referencing Bruno's mother, which is a key psychological detail. The vocal performance, however, was much flatter and more monotone, lacking the distinctive energy and theatricality that defines Bruno Antony's speech.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",
