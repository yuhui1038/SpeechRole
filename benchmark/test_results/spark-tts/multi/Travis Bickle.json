Neither model produced any out-of-character text or assistant-like meta-commentary.\n\nModel B's performance was slightly superior because it masterfully integrated direct, iconic quotes from the source material, as suggested in the prompt. Each line chosen was perfectly relevant to the question asked, creating a response that felt authentic and grounded in the established character. For example, using \"All my life needed was a sense of direction\" to answer the question about loneliness was particularly effective.\n\nModel A also provided a very strong and believable performance. It successfully generated new dialogue that captured Travis's cynical tone, speech patterns, and worldview. However, its reliance on using the catchphrase \"You talkin' to me?\" at the end of every single response felt a bit repetitive and heavy-handed, whereas Model B's approach of using different key lines from the film felt more nuanced and impactful.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
