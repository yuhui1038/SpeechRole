There were no instances of assistant-like language or out-of-character meta-commentary.\n\nModel A captured the energetic, slightly exasperated, and bubbly vocal cadence often associated with Penny. The phrasing and vocabulary felt very natural to the character. Model B, while having a slightly calmer vocal delivery, excelled in its content. It integrated specific details and phrases from the show, such as the \"Sheldon-y way\" of doing things, his calling her \"culturally aberrant,\" and the specific example of teaching him to knock. This use of concrete examples from the character's history made its portrayal feel exceptionally authentic and well-researched.
