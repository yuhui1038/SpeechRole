Model B, in contrast, relies almost exclusively on lifting direct quotes from the provided character script. While this ensures it stays in character, it fails to engage dynamically with the user's questions. Its second response is a non-sequitur that simply continues the script rather than answering the user's query, making the role-play feel static and less intelligent.
