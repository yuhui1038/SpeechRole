The final metaphor, \"我们是一个壶里尿的人\" (We piss in the same pot), is a brilliantly coarse and authentic expression of camaraderie that is perfectly in character.\n\nModel A, while maintaining a generally gruff tone, makes significant factual errors about the character's background and his relationship with his political commissar, stating incorrectly that Zhao Gang is his superior. This violates the instruction to \"know all of the knowledge of 李云龙\".
