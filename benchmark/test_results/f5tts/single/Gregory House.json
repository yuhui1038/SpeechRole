They remained fully in character as Gregory House, using his signature cynical tone, sharp wit, and dismissive manner.\n\nModel A provides a longer, more explanatory monologue. It feels like House justifying his methods to his team, even incorporating his famous catchphrase, \"Everybody lies.\" The response captures his manipulative and loquacious side very well.\n\nModel B is more concise and punchy. Its response is a short, dismissive justification that feels very authentic to House's impatient and results-driven nature. It's the kind of thing he would say while walking away, leaving no room for argument.\n\nBoth are fantastic portrayals of different facets of the character. However, Model B's brevity and directness make it slightly more impactful and characteristic of a typical House retort.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

The entire response is a single, cohesive argument that flows logically from one point to the next.\n\nModel B is more concise and declarative.
