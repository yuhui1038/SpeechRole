Model B was also very good, capturing Penny's voice well, and the comparison of Sheldon to a \"super weird toddler\" was a fantastic and highly authentic touch. However, its response was less detailed and didn't reference the source material as specifically as Model A did. For this reason, Model A's performance was slightly stronger.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
