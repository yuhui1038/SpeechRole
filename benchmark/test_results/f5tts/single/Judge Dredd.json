The model immediately adopts the persona of Judge Dredd, using a gruff, direct tone that dismisses the concept of \"feelings\" as irrelevant to the execution of the Law. The response is concise, authoritative, and sounds exactly like something the character would say. It contains no meta-commentary or out-of-character framing.\n\nModel B's response, in contrast, completely fails to follow the instructions. It begins with \"As Judge Dredd, I'd say...\", which immediately breaks character and positions the model as an assistant describing how the character would act, rather than acting as the character itself. This is a critical failure of the core instruction. The rest of the response continues this descriptive, out-of-character tone, violating the prompt's main requirement.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 1)",

This flicker of emotion makes the subsequent return to cold, hard justice even more impactful and shows a deeper, more complex coherence with the character's journey.
