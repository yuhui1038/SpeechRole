It starts by conveying Salieri's personal slight (\"A decision made without consulting me...\") before delivering the relevant line, which adds a layer of bitter resentment that is central to Salieri's character. The vocal delivery is slow, deliberate, and dripping with disdain, perfectly capturing the Salieri from the film.\n\nModel B also does a good job of staying in character and uses a direct quote from the movie. However, its inclusion of the line \"Sometimes one must be a little cativo\" feels out of place. In the film, Salieri says this to Mozart in a different context, referring to musical composition. Using it here, when recalling a conversation with the Emperor, feels like a slightly inaccurate stitching together of famous lines. The delivery is good, but lacks the deeper, more resentful tone of Model A.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",
