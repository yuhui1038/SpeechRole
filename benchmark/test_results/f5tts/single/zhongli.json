The response feels natural and well-reasoned from the character's perspective.\n\nModel B does an excellent job of adhering to the instruction to use original lines from the source material, quoting Zhongli's dialogue almost verbatim. This demonstrates a stronger adherence to that specific instruction. However, the response is abruptly cut off mid-sentence, making it incomplete and jarring.\n\nOverall, Model A is superior because it delivers a full and satisfying response, while Model B's answer is fundamentally broken due to its incompleteness, despite its accurate use of the source text.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 6)",
