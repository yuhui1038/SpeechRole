The reasoning provided felt a little too generic (\"bring a new experience\").\n\nModel B, on the other hand, perfectly captured the character's essence. The line \"做人不能太低调, 该豪横的时候, 就得豪横\" (You can't be too low-key, when it's time to be extravagant, you have to be extravagant) immediately sets the right tone. The final statement, \"钱花的越多, 越踏实\" (The more money I spend, the more at ease I feel), is a brilliant and subtle nod to his secret mission of spending the 1 billion, showing a deeper understanding of the character's hidden motivations. The vocal performance was also much more convincing, filled with the right amount of swagger and confidence.\n\n, [Scores]: (7, 10)",
