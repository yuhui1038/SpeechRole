Neither broke character or included any assistant-like meta-commentary.\n\nModel B's performance was slightly superior due to its more authentic portrayal. It effectively integrated direct quotes from the novel (\"Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon.\") and its original lines felt more like they were lifted from Rorschach's journal—terse, declarative, and absolute. Model A was also very good, capturing the gruff tone well, but it felt a little less nuanced by using the full, famous catchphrase in both of its answers. Model B's responses were more varied and arguably more true to the character's specific voice throughout the source material.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

This creates a very tight, escalating argument. Model B is also highly coherent, connecting its core belief in principles to the necessity of actions that others might deem dangerous. However, Model A's direct rhetorical turn—\"You think I'm the one who's dangerous? You're the ones who are blind\"—makes for a more dynamic and interconnected dialogue.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
