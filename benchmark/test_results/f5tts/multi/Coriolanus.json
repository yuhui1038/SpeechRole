The prosody is perfectly consistent between rounds, shifting from outrage to haughty dismissal, but the overall performance lacks the raw, dangerous edge that Model A's voice projects.\n\nUltimately, Model A's prosody is more effective because its chosen vocal style—the gravelly, forceful delivery—better embodies the core of Coriolanus's character: a man of war who is fundamentally unsuited for the subtleties of peace and politics, and whose primary mode of expression is barely-contained violence.\n\n, [Scores]: (10, 9)",
