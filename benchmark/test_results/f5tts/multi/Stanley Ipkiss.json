It incorporated a specific reference from the film (\"Tex Avery cartoon\") and directly addressed the provided script context about the mask returning like a \"boomerang.\" Furthermore, its answers demonstrated a deeper understanding of Stanley's core motivations, particularly the fear of \"go[ing] back to being invisible again.\" This nuance made the performance feel much richer and more true to the film's character arc.\n\nModel A was also very good. It successfully captured Stanley's internal conflict and consistently used the \"Ssssmokin'!\" catchphrase. The portrayal was consistent and believable, but it lacked the specific details and deeper psychological insight that made Model B's responses stand out.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
