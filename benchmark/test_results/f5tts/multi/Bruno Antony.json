The second response, alluding to solving Guy's \"problem,\" was chillingly in character.\n\nModel B was also good, correctly referencing Bruno's key line (\"I admire people who do things\") and his relationship with his mother. However, the justification for his actions (\"I'm just trying to be friendly\") and the self-awareness (\"Maybe I come on too strong\") felt slightly too simple and less psychologically complex than Bruno's actual character.
