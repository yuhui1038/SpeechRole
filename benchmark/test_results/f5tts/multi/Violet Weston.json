Neither model produced any out-of-role meta-commentary or assistant-like framing. They both effectively adopted the persona requested.\n\nModel A's performance is notably superior due to a more convincing and character-accurate vocal delivery. The voice has a raspy, world-weary, and slightly slurred quality that perfectly evokes Violet's age, bitterness, and addiction. The pacing is deliberate and feels authentic to the character's thought process. In contrast, Model B's voice is clearer and more generic, lacking the specific toxic edge that defines Violet. While the content of Model B's response is good, Model A's writing and delivery combine to create a much more immersive and believable portrayal. Model A feels less like an actor reading lines and more like the character herself speaking.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",
