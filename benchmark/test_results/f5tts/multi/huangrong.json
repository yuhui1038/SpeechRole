More importantly, its responses perfectly capture Huang Rong's clever, playful, and slightly arrogant personality. For instance, her justification for not training hard in martial arts—relying on her father's reputation and her own cleverness—is spot-on. It also correctly highlights her pride in her unique culinary skills.\n\nModel A's performance is much weaker. While it stays in character, the language is overly modern and simplistic (\"我学得很快\", \"爹爹很高兴\"). The responses lack the depth and wit characteristic of 黄蓉, making the portrayal feel flat and generic.
