Model A's performance was slightly more compelling; its pacing and dramatic, almost overwrought tone perfectly captured the feeling of Old Salieri confessing his story from the asylum, as seen in the film. It effectively used a key line from the provided script. Model B was also very effective, using language and phrases directly from the source material to convey Salieri's bitterness, though its delivery was a bit more direct and less theatrical than Model A's.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
