It not only used the provided script lines but also wove them into a more dynamic and engaging conversation, adding personal flourishes like \"本堂主亲自设计的\" (personally designed by me, the Hall Master) and a playful sales pitch about a \"独家优惠\" (exclusive discount). The vocal performance was also more energetic and expressive, perfectly capturing Hu Tao's spirit.\n\nModel B was good and accurate, correctly using the script to answer the question. However, its response was more direct and less embellished, feeling more like a straightforward recitation of the provided lines rather than a full embodiment of the character's persona.
