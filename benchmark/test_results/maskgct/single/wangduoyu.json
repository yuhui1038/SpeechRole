The language used, such as \"兄弟\" (brother), \"不能太低调\" (can't be too low-key), and \"豪横\" (extravagant), perfectly captures the character's voice. Its explanation, \"钱花的越多，越踏实\" (the more money I spend, the more at ease I feel), is a brilliant line that hints at the character's secret mission without revealing it, which is a core part of the role-play instructions.\n\nModel A follows the instructions by using a direct quote from the movie, but the surrounding text is rather bland and explanatory. It lacks the arrogant and over-the-top energy that defines Wang Duoyu. The delivery feels more like a calm explanation than a boast, failing to fully capture the character's essence.\n\n, [Scores]: (6, 10)",
