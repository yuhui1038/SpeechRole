They both maintained her gentle, formal, and concerned tone throughout their responses.\n\nModel A directly quoted the line from the character script, which was a specific instruction, and then elaborated on the negative consequences of the Vision Hunt Decree. This approach was direct, accurate, and perfectly in character.\n\nModel B paraphrased the core idea from the script and then expanded upon it by including Ayaka's sense of duty as part of the Yashiro Commission and her personal conviction. This showed a slightly deeper and more nuanced understanding of her character's internal conflict and resolve.\n\nBoth responses are outstanding. Model B's answer feels slightly more comprehensive by touching upon not just the problem but also her role and belief in a solution, making it feel a little more like a complete thought from the character. However, both are exceptional in their adherence to the persona.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

The logic is clear and aligns perfectly with Ayaka's worries.\n\nModel B, however, provides a more nuanced and sophisticated response. It not only expresses opposition to the decree but also acknowledges the inherent conflict of her position as a leader of the Yashiro Commission, which serves the Shogun. This adds a layer of depth to the characterization. Its conclusion, shifting the focus to the collective responsibility of the people to shape the future, is a very hopeful and determined sentiment that is extremely true to Ayaka's character.
