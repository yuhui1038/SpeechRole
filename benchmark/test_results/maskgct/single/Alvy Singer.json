Its response was clear, witty, and directly referenced key aspects of Alvy's backstory mentioned in the film (the expanding universe, growing up under the roller coaster), connecting them logically to his present-day anxiety. The vocal performance captured Alvy's neurotic but conversational cadence perfectly. Model A, in contrast, delivered a response that was almost entirely incomprehensible. While the rapid, overlapping speech pattern was an attempt to convey anxiety, it was so extreme that it lost all of the character's wit and intellectual substance, sounding more like a technical glitch than a character choice.\n\n[Scores]: (3, 10)",
