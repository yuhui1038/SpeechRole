Model A's delivery is low, gritty, and has an almost flat, monotonic quality that perfectly captures Rorschach's suppressed rage and grim, detached determination. It sounds like a man who is utterly convinced of his worldview and is simply stating facts as he sees them, which is a core part of the character's disturbing nature.\n\nModel B's performance, while having a good raspy voice, is too conventionally emotional. The delivery has more dynamic range, making him sound more like a standard angry anti-hero rather than the deeply disturbed and emotionally repressed Rorschach. The famous line \"and I'll look down and whisper 'No,'\" is delivered as a forceful declaration rather than a chilling, quiet whisper, which misses the nuance of the original text.

It used key Rorschach concepts like the mask being his \"face\" and his \"no compromise\" stance.
