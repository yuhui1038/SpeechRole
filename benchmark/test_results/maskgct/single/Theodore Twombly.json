Model A provided a thoughtful, psychological explanation for his reluctance to let go, which felt very true to the character's journey of self-discovery. Model B's response felt slightly more grounded in the specific emotions Theodore expressed in the film, and its phrasing, \"It's hard when you grow up with someone,\" felt very much like a direct line or sentiment from the original script, which was a specific instruction in the prompt.
