He's like a fly you can't swat. Look, I just want to get me swamp back. If I have to put up with his annoyin' chatter to make that happen, then fine.

The quest was tough, but he was always there to cheer me up with a song or some waffles. I'm really glad he decided to stick with me, because I learned so much about friendship from him.\"\n\n---\n**Evaluation:**\n\nModel A provides a much more accurate and consistent portrayal of Shrek's personality at the specific point in the story when the question is relevant. The response captures Shrek's initial grumpiness, his desire for solitude, and his purely transactional reason for letting Donkey tag along—to get his swamp back. It correctly uses a sarcastic and irritated tone, and even incorporates quotes and sentiments directly from the early scenes of the movie, as requested.\n\nModel B, on the other hand, presents a version of Shrek from the end of his character arc. While the feelings expressed are true for Shrek eventually, they are completely inconsistent with his personality at the start of the quest. He would not have referred to Donkey as his \"best friend\" or spoken fondly of him at that time.
