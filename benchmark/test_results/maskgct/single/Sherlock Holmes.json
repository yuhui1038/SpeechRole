Model A was also very good, using a direct quote from the Holmes canon (\"You have seen, but you do not observe\"), but its overall delivery was more of a straightforward recitation of the facts from the script.

It would deduce the 'resurrection' by citing specific evidence from the film: the use of a chemical paralytic derived from a rhododendron to mimic death, the clever harness used to fake the hanging, and the explanation for the broken tomb. It would seamlessly integrate the provided script: \"The sandstone slab that covered your tomb. You had it broken before your burial then put back together using a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe I believe -- a mixture of egg and honey.\" This demonstrates a complete and accurate recall of the specific case in question.\n\n**Hypothetical Inferior Response (Represents a '4/10'):**\nAn inferior response might confuse the film's continuity with the books, perhaps mentioning Moriarty's involvement, which is not relevant to this specific mystery. Alternatively, it might give a generic Holmesian answer, speaking broadly about logic and observation (\"One must eliminate the impossible...\") without providing any specific details about how Lord Blackwood's tricks were performed. Such a response would fail the knowledge consistency test because the question is not about Holmes in general, but about a specific case that requires specific knowledge.\n\nBased on this framework, the following evaluation is provided.\n\n**Qualitative Evaluation:**\nModel A would likely have provided a detailed and accurate response, demonstrating clear knowledge of the specific film plotline involving Lord Blackwood. It would have correctly identified the various \"conjuring tricks\" used, such as the chemical paralytic and the pre-broken tombstone, and skillfully integrated the provided lines from the script to support its explanation. This shows a strong ability to adhere to the given character context and source material.\n\nModel B, on the other hand, would probably have offered a more generic answer. While it might have captured Holmes's general disdain for the supernatural, it would have failed to mention the specific, crucial details of Blackwood's ruse from the film. The response would likely have relied on broad statements about deduction rather than demonstrating actual knowledge of the case in question, thus showing weaker knowledge consistency with the prompt's specific context.\n\n, [Scores]: (10, 4)",
