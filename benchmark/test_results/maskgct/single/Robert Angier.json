They both successfully capture the character's obsessed, theatrical, and tragic nature, avoiding any out-of-character meta-commentary.\n\nModel A feels slightly more powerful and authentic. Its opening, \"Warned me? *Everyone* warned me,\" is a fantastic, dismissive start that perfectly captures Angier's persona. It effectively weaves in the core motivations: the rivalry with Borden, the desire for a \"miracle\" rather than a trick, and the ultimate goal of seeing \"the look on their faces.\" It also directly uses the provided line \"Price... is not an object,\" grounding the response in the source material.\n\nModel B is also excellent. It directly quotes another line from the script, \"if you understand an obsession, then you know there is nothing that can change my mind,\" which is a strong choice. The metaphor \"whispers in a hurricane of my own making\" is also very fitting for the character. However, Model A's overall narrative flow feels slightly more natural and impactful as a direct answer to the question.\n\nWhile both are top-tier, Model A's performance has a slight edge due to its more conversational and performative delivery, which feels exceptionally true to the character.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

This demonstrates a stronger grasp of the source material.
