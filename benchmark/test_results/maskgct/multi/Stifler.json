They remained fully in character for both rounds without any assistant-like commentary.\n\nModel B's performance, however, was slightly more authentic. The vocal delivery captured Stifler's loud, chaotic energy and boisterous laugh more effectively. For instance, in the first round, Model B cleverly twisted a line from the provided script (\"he wets his pants\") into a very Stifler-like boast (\"I almost wet *my* pants laughing!\"). This creative touch made the portrayal feel more natural and less like a simple recitation of character traits. Model A was very good, but Model B's performance had that extra layer of unhinged energy that defines the character.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

In its first response, it fabricates an out-of-character emotion by claiming Stifler \"felt a little bad for him.\" This is a major contradiction, as Stifler consistently thrives on the humiliation of others, especially Sherman. The second response is also weak; while it correctly states Sherman wasn't in the group, it incorrectly suggests Stifler \"wasn't really keeping score,\" which is contrary to his highly competitive and status-obsessed nature.
