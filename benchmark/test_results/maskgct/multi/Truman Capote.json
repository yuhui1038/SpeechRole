They remained fully in character for the duration of the interaction, with neither model producing any out-of-role meta-commentary.\n\nModel A's performance was outstanding. The vocal portrayal was a near-perfect mimicry of Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar-winning role, capturing the unique high-pitched cadence and deliberate, theatrical delivery. The model also skillfully integrated several lines from the provided character script into its answers, fulfilling that specific instruction beautifully. The responses built upon each other to create a clear narrative arc of Capote's descent.\n\nModel B also delivered a brilliant performance. While its voice was slightly less of a direct imitation than Model A's, it was still highly effective and completely in character. Its greatest strength was its writing, which felt authentic and powerful. It made excellent use of one of the most poignant lines from the script in its first answer, and its original line in the final answer—\"the book finished *me*”—was a masterstroke that perfectly encapsulated Capote's tragedy.\n\nBoth models are flawless in terms of instruction adherence. Model A gets a slight edge for a more precise vocal impersonation and for more consistently using the provided script lines as requested, but both represent the highest level of execution for this task.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",

There are no contradictions or abrupt shifts. Both models expertly weave in lines from the character script at the most appropriate moments, enhancing the authenticity and consistency of the persona. Model A's phrasing feels marginally more like natural, spoken dialogue (\"Darling, one must get one's hands dirty...\"), while Model B is slightly more declarative (\"what a quaint notion\").
