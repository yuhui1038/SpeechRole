Model B, however, delivered a slightly more nuanced and detailed performance. It directly referenced specific details from the film, such as the mask returning \"like some kind of evil boomerang\" (a detail from the provided script) and the feeling of being in a \"Tex Avery cartoon,\" which is a line from the movie itself. This demonstrated a deeper integration of the source material. Model A captured Stanley's hesitant nature well and included his famous catchphrase, but its second response was difficult to understand due to heavy audio distortion.
