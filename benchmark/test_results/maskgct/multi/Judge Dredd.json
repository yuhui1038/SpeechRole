Model A speaks directly as the character from the first word to the last, fully immersing the user in the interaction. Model B, while largely in character, begins its first response with the phrase, \"As Judge Dredd...\", which is a form of meta-commentary. This momentarily breaks the fourth wall and frames the response as an AI *performing* a role, rather than simply *being* the role, which is a slight deviation from the core instruction to \"act like Judge Dredd.\" Model A's seamless and uninterrupted character portrayal is therefore a more faithful execution of the prompt.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",
