Its responses perfectly capture 鸠摩智's defining traits: feigned humility, boundless ambition, and cunning hypocrisy. For example, in the final round, it frames the \"public outrage\" as mere jealousy from lesser men (\"世人忌贤妒能\"), which is a masterful and authentic portrayal of his manipulative nature.\n\nModel A captures the surface-level arrogance and formal speech patterns of the character but occasionally misses the mark on his core motivations. Its justification for pressuring Shaolin, for instance, sounds more like a generic philosophical statement than the self-aggrandizing and duplicitous reasoning that 鸠摩智 would employ. Model B's performance is consistently more authentic and feels as if it were lifted directly from the pages of the novel.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 10)",
