Its responses felt more natural and conversational, as if Guo靖 were genuinely reflecting on the questions. It masterfully blended direct quotes (or close paraphrases) with original phrasing that still felt authentic to the character. For example, in the second round, it directly used the line \"就是普天下的人要一齐跟你为难，我也始终护着你,\" which perfectly answers the question.\n\nModel A also did a good job, especially by using the direct quote about staying on Peach Blossom Island. However, its repetition of the same quote in the first two rounds made the response feel a bit limited. The audio delivery also contained some unnatural pauses and sounds that were slightly distracting.\n\nOverall, Model B provided a more nuanced and convincing portrayal of the character.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 9)",
