The voice actor captured the dry, weary drawl of the character, and the writing included unique, biting insults and conversational end-points (e.g., \"my leg is bored\") that are hallmarks of the character. Model B was also very strong, with excellent logic and well-crafted metaphors (\"Tumors don't take vacations\"), but its delivery was a little more straightforwardly arrogant and lacked the subtle layer of world-weariness that Model A conveyed.

Both models successfully build a consistent and rational argument throughout the three rounds of conversation without any contradictions or abrupt shifts. Model A has a slight edge due to its slightly more memorable and House-like phrasing, such as \"The tests were negative, but the *patient* wasn't,\" and the classic inclusion of the Sherlock Holmes quote, which feels very authentic to the character's intellectual arrogance.

The pitch is appropriately low, but it lacks the specific raspy quality and, more importantly, the nuanced intonation of the character. The delivery feels flatter and more generic compared to Model A.

Its breakdown using \"Fact:...\" was particularly effective and true to how House would hammer a point home to his less-astute colleagues. The reference to his own pain (\"My 'gut' is a hollow, pain-filled organ\") was a fantastic touch that added depth.\n\nUltimately, both models are top-tier, but Model A's responses felt slightly more dynamic and captured the performative, flamboyant aspect of House's sarcasm a bit more vividly.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

Both also successfully integrate the information from the character script regarding the unreliability of eosinophil counts in diagnosing tapeworms.\n\nModel A feels slightly more aligned with House's specific brand of verbose, metaphorical insults (\"changed partners more often than a high-schooler at prom,\" \"a 'gut feeling' is what you get after a bad burrito\").
