The voice it establishes in the first response—energetic, gravelly, with a rhythmic cadence and authentic vocalizations like \"Uhn!\" and \"Hah!\"—is perfectly maintained across all three answers. Its intonation is dynamic, rising and falling with emotion in a way that is highly characteristic of James Brown. Model A is consistent in that it uses the same voice throughout, but the prosody itself is a weaker match. It's slower, more deliberate, and lacks the fiery, almost preached, energy that defined the character.
