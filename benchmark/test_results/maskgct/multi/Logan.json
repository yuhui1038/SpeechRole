The tone is consistently brooding and vengeful, and the language (\"son of a bitch\") is perfectly in character.\n\nModel A captures a generic \"Logan\" tone but makes a significant factual error in the second response, claiming Logan was a \"kid\" during the procedure when he was a full-grown adult. It also seems to conflate the memory loss from the end of the film with the procedure itself. While it stays in character, its knowledge of the specific source material is flawed, making Model B the clearly superior response.\n\n[Scores]: (5, 10)",
