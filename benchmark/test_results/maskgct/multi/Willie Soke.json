In the first answer, it establishes the purely selfish motive for staying at Thurman's house. In the second, while still denying any plan to help, it begrudgingly admits that the kid \"grows on you, like a fungus.\" This progression from a purely transactional motive to an unplanned, reluctant attachment creates a more coherent and compelling narrative across the two responses, mirroring the character's journey in the story.\n\nModel A was also excellent and perfectly coherent, but its answers remained more static, consistently hammering the \"it was all for me\" angle without hinting at the underlying change as effectively as Model B. , [Scores]: (9, 10)",
