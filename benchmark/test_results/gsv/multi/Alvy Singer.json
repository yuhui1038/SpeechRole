It not only used the direct quotes flawlessly (\"right turn on a red light,\" \"I'm into garbage,\" \"ripen and then I rot\") but the original dialogue it generated felt exceptionally authentic to Alvy's specific neurotic, self-analytical worldview. The line, \"I can't enjoy anything unless everyone else is miserable too.
