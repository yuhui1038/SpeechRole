While the information it provides is technically correct (he's from a peasant family, Zhao is his superior), the delivery is flat and explanatory rather than performative. It lacks the fire, coarseness, and specific mannerisms that define Li Yunlong, sounding more like a database reciting facts about the character than the character himself.\n\n, [Scores]: (3, 10)",
