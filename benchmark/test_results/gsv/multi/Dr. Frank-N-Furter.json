They both successfully adopt the persona of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, incorporating iconic lines and creating new dialogue that fits the character's flamboyant and hedonistic personality. Model B's vocal performance is slightly more impressive, capturing the deep, purring, and theatrical tone of the original character more accurately than Model A's higher-pitched interpretation.
