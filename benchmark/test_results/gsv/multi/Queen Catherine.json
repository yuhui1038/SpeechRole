The first response is a series of fragmented questions directed at Nostradamus, which sets a scene rather than directly answering the user's question about her reaction. The second response is a strong, self-contained answer, but it doesn't flow as naturally from the first. The transition from setting a scene to providing a reflective monologue feels less like a developing conversation and more like two separate script excerpts.\n\n, [Scores]: (7, 10)",

The emotion is one of controlled power and political pragmatism. While this is certainly a key aspect of Catherine's personality, the performance feels slightly less varied.
