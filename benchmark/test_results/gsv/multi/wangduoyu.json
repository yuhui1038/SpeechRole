Model B fully commits to the role of 王多鱼, perfectly capturing his flashy, nouveau-riche persona without revealing his secret objective. The responses are creative, witty, and sound exactly like something the character would say.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, makes a critical error by immediately revealing the secret plot of having to spend 1 billion to inherit 30 billion. This is a direct violation of the instructions, which state that this secret cannot be told to anyone. While its second response correctly uses a line from the movie, the initial failure to adhere to the core rules of the character's situation breaks the entire role-playing experience.
