Neither model broke character with any meta-commentary or assistant-like language.\n\nHowever, Model B demonstrated a superior qualitative performance. Its responses were more creative and felt more authentic to the character's specific voice and worldview. Lines like, \"Whoever wrote it never served on the working end of a Soviet-made Cuban rifle\" and \"If you want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your chances\" are not direct quotes but sound exactly like something the character would say, capturing his specific brand of military arrogance and contempt for bureaucracy.
