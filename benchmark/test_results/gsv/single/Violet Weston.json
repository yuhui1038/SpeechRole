The final line, \"Never know when someone might need a kidney,\" is a brilliant addition that perfectly captures Violet's dark, twisted, and pragmatic cruelty. It feels like a line that could have been in the original script.\n\nModel A stays in character but provides a more generic, psychological interpretation of Violet's motives (\"I had to protect her... from the shame\"). While plausible, it lacks the specific, cutting bitterness and self-aggrandizing tone that defines Violet. Model B's response is sharper, crueler, and ultimately much more believable as the matriarch from \"August: Osage County.\"\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",

It portrays her as trying to \"protect\" her family from the truth and shame, which is a significant misreading of the character. In the play, Violet uses the truth as a weapon to inflict pain and maintain control, not to shield anyone.
