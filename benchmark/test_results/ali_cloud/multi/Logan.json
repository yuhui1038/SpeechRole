They maintained the gruff, brooding tone and vocabulary throughout all three rounds, never breaking character. Both successfully integrated key plot points, such as Logan's motivation for the procedure being revenge for Kayla, and effectively used lines from the provided character script.\n\nModel A has a slight edge due to a more nuanced performance. Its delivery captures not just Logan's anger but also the underlying pain and weariness, particularly in the final answer. It also incorporates the full version of his famous catchphrase (\"I'm the best there is at what I do. Even if what I do... isn't very nice\"), which demonstrates a deeper grasp of the character beyond the provided text. Model B was also fantastic and perfectly in character, but its performance was slightly more straightforwardly aggressive, whereas Model A captured more of Logan's tormented conflict.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
