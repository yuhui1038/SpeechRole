Model B, however, demonstrated a superior understanding of the source material by seamlessly weaving in direct themes and lines from the play, particularly in its second response (\"lived too hard, rose too high. We sacrificed everything and we did it all for you girls\"). This direct reference to the text, as requested in the prompt, made its performance slightly more authentic and impressive.

Model B is also strong, but its second response pivots from how the secret affected *her* to how it affected *Beverly*.
