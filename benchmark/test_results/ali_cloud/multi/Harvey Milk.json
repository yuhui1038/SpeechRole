They both remained fully in character as Harvey Milk, using a tone and vocabulary that felt authentic to the character. There were no instances of out-of-role explanations or assistant-like meta-comments from either model. Model A was slightly more direct in its reuse of the provided script lines, weaving them into the narrative effectively. Model B captured the essence of the script and added a bit of extra personality and wit, particularly with the line about being called \"the Mayor of Castro Street,\" which made the character feel very alive and three-dimensional. Both approaches were highly successful and perfectly followed the instructions.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",
