It also directly and correctly utilizes a line from the provided script (\"Eosinophil count... 30% of cases\"), demonstrating perfect adherence to the instructions. The original lines it generates, such as \"tumors are boring\" and \"we're not making cars here,\" are exceptionally authentic.\n\nModel A also does a very good job of staying in character. It captures House's general arrogance, dismissive tone, and core philosophy (\"Everybody lies\"). The responses are logical and delivered in a way that fits the character's personality. However, it lacks the specific case details and the sharp, punchy dialogue that make Model B's performance so convincing. Model A's portrayal is a good general impersonation, whereas Model B's feels like the character's direct voice.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",

For example, it references the specific clinical details of the case (steroids making her worse) and uses the line about the eosinophil count from the provided script. It also creates a strong thematic link between its second and third answers by mentioning \"probabilities not guarantees\" and then following up with \"we're not making cars here. Don't give guarantees,\" which demonstrates superior coherence across turns. Model A was also very strong, developing a consistent argument about pattern recognition versus gut feelings, but Model B's adherence to the source material and its thematic linking was slightly more impressive.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

While the voice itself was consistent throughout the rounds, it was consistently *not* the character's voice.
