They stayed completely in character as Jordan Belfort, skillfully weaving lines and concepts from the provided script into their original, in-character dialogue. The tone, vocabulary, and arrogant confidence were perfectly captured by both. Model B's use of metaphors like \"battleship\" and \"pure, uncut... URGENCY\" felt slightly more creative and deeply rooted in the character's specific world, giving it a marginal edge in flair. However, Model A was equally flawless in its execution, with its own excellent character-consistent phrases like \"unleashed them\" and \"transfer of conviction.\" In terms of the core instruction—to stay in character and avoid assistant-like comments—both were perfect.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",

Model B's responses were both individually strong and in character, but they felt a little more like separate answers to distinct questions rather than a single, flowing explanation.

Its key strength is in the second response. It successfully modulates its voice, delivering \"URGENCY\" with force and then audibly lowering its tone and slowing its pace for the subsequent lines.

In both rounds, it explicitly mentions the \"Straight Line\" sales system by name, which is a cornerstone of Belfort's methodology. Furthermore, its second answer correctly connects the aggressive selling not just to the on-the-phone tactics but also to the powerful motivation provided by the promise of an extravagant lifestyle (cars, women, etc.), which paints a more complete and accurate picture of the Stratton Oakmont culture.
