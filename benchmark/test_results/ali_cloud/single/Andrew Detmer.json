They both remained fully in character as Andrew Detmer, without any assistant-like meta-commentary.\n\nModel B's performance felt slightly more authentic to the character. Its vocal delivery had a hesitant, mumbled quality that perfectly captured Andrew's introverted and troubled nature. The line \"And I need proof, evidence, especially with my dad and everything\" was a particularly strong addition, as it showed a deep understanding of the character's core motivations and trauma, which is a central theme in the story.\n\nModel A also provided a very strong, in-character response, correctly using lines from the provided script and capturing the character's growing sense of power and defiance. However, Model B's inclusion of the more vulnerable, specific reason related to his father gave it a slight edge in character depth and authenticity.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

Model B was also excellent and coherent, providing very specific and accurate reasons for Andrew's filming, such as needing evidence against his father.
