This creates a very logical and powerful argument that perfectly explains the character's cycle of relapse.

Phrases like \"it's a vicious cycle, mate\" and \"it becomes the problem itself\" lack the unique, sharp-edged cynicism of Renton. The response feels like a summary of addiction rather than an in-character monologue.
