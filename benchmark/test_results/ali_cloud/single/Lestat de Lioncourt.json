They adopt the persona completely, without any out-of-character remarks or assistant-like framing. Both also successfully incorporate the provided reference line about Akasha's blood. Model B, however, captures the character's voice with a slightly greater depth and poetic flair. The line \"I merely answered the call I had spent my whole existence screaming into the darkness\" is particularly effective and feels more authentically like Lestat's grand, dramatic introspection.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

Its response flows as a single, eloquent monologue, where each sentence logically and poetically builds upon the last. It connects the seduction not just to Akasha's immediate power but to Lestat's entire existential quest (\"the call I had spent my whole existence screaming into the darkness\"), which demonstrates a deeper consistency with the character's overall motivations.\n\nModel A's response is also coherent and factually correct, but it is delivered in a series of short, fragmented statements. While each statement is logically sound on its own, the overall effect is less cohesive and fluid than Model B's more integrated and narrative answer.\n\n, [Scores]: (8, 10)",
