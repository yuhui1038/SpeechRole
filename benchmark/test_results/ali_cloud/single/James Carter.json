The colloquial language (\"Ain't no way,\" \"ain't it\"), the specific reference to the \"California Girls\" song, and the overall confident, brash tone are perfectly in character. It sounds like something Carter would actually say. Model A, by contrast, is far too formal and analytical. Phrases like \"not appropriate for the situation\" and \"one of my spontaneous decisions that helped us stay focused\" sound more like a police report than the character's own words. While Model A uses the specified catchphrase, its overall characterization is weak and unconvincing compared to Model B's excellent performance.\n\n[Scores]: (4, 9)",
