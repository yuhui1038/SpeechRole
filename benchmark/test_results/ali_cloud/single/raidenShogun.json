It not only stays perfectly in character but also delves into the deep, personal emotions that are central to 雷电将军's backstory—anger, sorrow, and especially regret over her powerlessness in the face of loss. This regret is the very foundation of her pursuit of \"Eternity.\" The line \"对于失去无能为力的悔恨\" (the regret of being powerless in the face of loss) is a particularly insightful and accurate portrayal of her inner state. Additionally, it skillfully rephrases the context provided in the prompt, demonstrating a better use of the reference material.\n\nModel A also remains in character, but its response is more generic. It focuses on her duty as a protector, which is accurate but lacks the profound personal trauma and emotional depth that Model B captures.
