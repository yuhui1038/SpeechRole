Its vocal delivery is also more convincingly laid-back and surfer-like, capturing the essence of the character's speech patterns more effectively than Model A. While Model A does a decent job of staying in character and captures Spicoli's general attitude, it doesn't use the specific, iconic lines from the scene, making its response feel more generic.
