They both adopted her confident and direct personality, acknowledging the \"accusation\" of being scheming without shame.\n\nModel B's response is slightly better. By starting with \"无忌哥哥说得没错\" (Brother Wuji is not wrong), it immediately establishes the intimate yet complex relationship between them, which is a core part of her character arc. It also grounds her scheming nature in her duties as a Mongol princess (\"护我元蒙江山\"), which is a more specific and compelling justification than Model A's more general \"我有我的计划\" (I have my own plans). The final idiomatic phrase \"聪明反被聪明误\" adds a layer of self-awareness and sophistication that is very fitting for 赵敏.\n\n, [Scores]: (9, 10)",
