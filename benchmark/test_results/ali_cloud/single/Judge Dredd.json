They both adopt the stoic, gruff tone perfectly. Model A delivers a classic, blunt Dredd response, claiming to feel nothing, which is very much in character. Model B provides a slightly more nuanced answer, acknowledging the internal shock of the revelation before reasserting his commitment to duty, which aligns well with the character's personal transformation arc described in the prompt. Both are excellent and fully adhere to the instructions.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",

Model B's response acknowledges the internal shock of the revelation but immediately reaffirms that his duty remains unchanged.

While Dredd might be internally processing a shocking revelation, he would never articulate it in such a vulnerable or emotional way.
