The line, \"I thought climbing the legal ladder would give me everything, but all it gave me was missed moments and a disappointed little boy,\" was particularly strong and felt very authentic to the character's ultimate realization.

This added layer of self-analysis provides a deeper, more coherent look into the character's mindset and redemption arc.
