This creates a very strong and direct logical link between the provided context and the answer. Model B's answer is also logical but more general; it refers to \"ancient symbols\" and \"rituals\" without specifying the exact evidence that Holmes mentions in the script.

The delivery is fluid and maintains the same characterful cadence from start to finish. Model B's prosodic consistency is less successful. While the pitch is generally stable, the intonation is flatter and lacks the dynamic rise and fall of natural speech, which makes it sound more like a text-to-speech reading.
