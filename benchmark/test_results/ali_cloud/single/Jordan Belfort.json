They successfully adopt his tone and vocabulary, and both incorporate the key line from the provided script (\"The other guys looked at me like I'd just discovered fire\"). Model B's performance is slightly more compelling; its language feels a bit more authentic to the character with the use of words like \"shmucks,\" and the audio delivery has a more manic, high-energy quality that is very reminiscent of the character's persona in the film. Model A is also excellent but adopts a slightly more measured, storytelling tone.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
