It effectively used different lines from the provided script to answer different questions, demonstrating a stronger ability to adapt its response to the specific context of each question. For example, in the second round, it used the line \"就是普天下的人要一齐跟你为难，我也始终护着你\" which was the perfect answer for that prompt. Model A, in contrast, repeated its first answer for the second question, which, while still in character, was less effective and felt less dynamic.
