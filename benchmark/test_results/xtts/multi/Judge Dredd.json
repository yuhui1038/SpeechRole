While it remains in character, its first response is simply a direct quote from the provided script, which doesn't fully answer the \"why\" of the question. It feels more like a script recitation than a genuine in-character response. The voice and tone are also less convincing and lack the gravitas of Model A.

It answered each question directly while building a consistent line of reasoning across the three rounds: Dredd sought Hershey because he believed she was the only one who could provide a fair trial (Round 1), clarified that this was a pragmatic choice rather than one based on personal trust (Round 2), and then explained that her unique sense of justice beyond the rigid letter of the law is what set her apart (Round 3). This progression is logical and maintains character consistency.\n\nModel B failed on the first question by simply quoting a line from the script where Dredd asks Hershey for help, rather than explaining *why* he asked her. This broke the conversational coherence from the start. While its second and third responses were somewhat coherent with each other, the dialogue as a whole was disjointed due to the initial non-answer. [Scores]: (9, 4)",
