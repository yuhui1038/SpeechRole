It skillfully weaves in references to other characters like her cousin Murong Fu, A'Zhu, and A'Bi, and connects her knowledge of medicine to specific, plausible events. The language used is elegant, classical, and perfectly captures the character's gentle yet melancholic tone.\n\nModel A attempts to stay in character but fails on key details. Its most significant error is mentioning the \"Nine Yin Manual\" (九阴真经), a core element from a different novel by the same author, which Wang Yuyan would not have known. This breaks the illusion of character knowledge. Its responses are also more generic and philosophical, lacking the specific personal touch and sorrowful undertones that define Wang Yuyan's persona as portrayed in Model B.\n\n, [Scores]: (3, 10)",
