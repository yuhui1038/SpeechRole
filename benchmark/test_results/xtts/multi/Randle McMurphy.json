Neither model broke character or used any out-of-character meta-commentary. They both successfully captured the rebellious, charismatic, and slightly crude tone of the character. Model B, however, felt slightly more authentic. It incorporated more specific and iconic phrases from the source material (like \"scratch their watches or wind their butts\"), which made its portrayal feel more vivid and grounded. Model A was very good, but its phrasing, while in character, was at times a little more generic.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
