This shift aligns perfectly with the character's deep-seated conflict. Model B, on the other hand, maintains a very consistent, gruff, and dismissive tone throughout.

It incorrectly attributes a line about his father (\"prick\") to his mother and repeatedly misuses the \"go get 'em, honey\" line as if it's Frank's own mantra, rather than a memory.
