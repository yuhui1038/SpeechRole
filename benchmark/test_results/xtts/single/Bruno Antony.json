They stayed entirely in character, adopting the manipulative tone and twisted logic of the source material without any out-of-role commentary. Model B gains a slight edge by directly incorporating one of the key lines provided in the character script (\"But, Guy, you wanted it! We planned it on the train together, remember?\"), which was a specific instruction in the prompt. Model A's performance was also excellent and authentic, but its phrasing was a creative interpretation rather than a direct reuse of the provided script lines.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
