It directly lifts or closely paraphrases Violet's iconic, darkly humorous lines from the play, perfectly answering the question with the character's actual reasoning. This demonstrates a deep and accurate knowledge of the source material, as requested. The tone is spot-on—dismissive, pragmatic, and utterly devoid of sentimentality. Model A also does a good job of capturing Violet's bitter and self-justifying tone, but it invents a more generic reason for her actions (\"I had to protect her\") rather than using the specific, memorable, and much more twisted justification from the text. While Model A's performance is strong and stays in character, Model B's accuracy and use of the original lines make it the superior response.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
