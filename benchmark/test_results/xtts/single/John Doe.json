Model B, however, provided a slightly more nuanced and powerful answer by directly linking his admiration for Mills' passion to his own confessed sin of envy.

While the tone is slow and deliberate, it leans into a more generic \"villain\" archetype, with more pronounced and dramatic emotional inflections. The condescension is present but feels more like standard villainous posturing rather than the deeply ingrained, philosophical contempt of John Doe.
