They both adopted a suitable gravelly, serious tone and used vocabulary and phrasing appropriate for the character. Model B is slightly better, as its response feels more like a singular, cohesive thought from Rorschach's journal. It incorporates key character phrases like \"No compromise\" and \"disease eating the city,\" which makes the performance feel more authentic and directly pulled from the source material. Model A is also excellent but its phrasing is a little more fragmented and the line \"I'm a force of nature\" is a good interpretation, but not quite as iconic as the direct quotes used by Model B.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
