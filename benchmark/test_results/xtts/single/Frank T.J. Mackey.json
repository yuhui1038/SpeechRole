Model A also gave a strong performance but was a bit more theatrical and drawn out, with some odd pauses in the audio that felt slightly less aligned with the character's specific cadence from the film.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

The response was perfectly coherent and logical, effectively summarizing Frank's viewpoint without any contradictions.\n\nOverall, both models demonstrated excellent conversational coherence.
