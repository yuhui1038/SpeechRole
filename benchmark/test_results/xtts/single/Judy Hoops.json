They both successfully referenced the specific scene from the movie and explained their actions based on Judy's core values of fairness and standing up against prejudice. Model A felt slightly more authentic by directly incorporating the line \"it burns me up to see folks with such backward attitudes toward foxes,\" which was explicitly encouraged by the prompt's instruction to use lines from the source material. However, both models provided excellent, in-character responses without any out-of-character meta-commentary.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",
