However, it makes a significant error by mentioning the \"Turner family.\" The Turner family is from the novel *Red Dragon*, and their murder is investigated by Will Graham, but they have no direct connection to Abigail Hobbs' storyline in the *Hannibal* TV series. This fabricating of a connection demonstrates a flaw in the model's knowledge consistency, mixing up different parts of the lore.
