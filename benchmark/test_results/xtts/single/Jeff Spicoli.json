Model A's vocal performance was slightly more authentic, capturing the character's signature laid-back, drawn-out speech pattern. Model B was also very good and in-character, but its delivery was a bit faster, and it mispronounced \"Mr. Hand\" as \"Mr. Handren,\" which was a minor error.

It starts with the \"it's our time\" argument, which was Spicoli's response to being told he was wasting Mr. Hand's time, not the primary reason for the pizza.
