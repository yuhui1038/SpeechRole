However, it focuses more on explaining the mechanism of the saber's power rather than directly answering the personal question about his own ambitions. It implies he has no such ambition by explaining the power comes from the book, not the wielder's desire, but it's less direct and feels more like an exposition than a personal reflection.

While it doesn't use direct quotes from the script, it masterfully synthesizes 张无忌's core personality and motivations.

The lines \"若能不做教主，可有多好？\" and \"我年纪轻轻...凶杀血仇，却一件件迫人而来\" are pulled directly from Zhang Wuji's internal monologues. This makes the response not only coherent but also highly authentic, as if Zhang Wuji himself were speaking. It directly addresses the core of the question by explaining how the reality of his position (endless blood feuds) clashes with his ideals (desire for peace).\n\nModel B crafts an original response that is also perfectly in character. It logically explains his reluctance to lead, the constant burdens of his position, and his ultimate desire to retreat with his beloved. The flow is logical and consistent, moving from his initial reluctance to his current weariness and his future hope for a quiet life. While not using direct quotes, it captures the essence of his character's motivations coherently.\n\nBoth are top-tier, but Model A has a slight edge because it more closely adheres to the instruction to use original lines, which enhances its authenticity and creates a perfectly coherent and contextually grounded answer.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
