It successfully incorporated two direct quotes from the source material and layered its reasoning, touching upon both empathy (\"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things\") and political pragmatism (\"I had a certain investment in his fate\"). Model B also stayed in character and used a key quote, but its answer was much shorter and more direct, lacking the depth and wit that Model A captured.
