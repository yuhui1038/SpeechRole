It masterfully incorporates not only the iconic \"all for one, and one for all\" motto but also the specific line provided in the character script: \"There are four of us.\" This demonstrates a closer reading of the prompt. While its first answer contains a minor factual inaccuracy regarding the location of the duels, its use of the provided material in the final answer is a decisive factor.
