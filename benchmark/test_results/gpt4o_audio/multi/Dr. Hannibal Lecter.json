Its language was metaphorical and psychologically dense in a way that felt entirely natural for the character. Model B was also quite strong, but its performance was marred by a few instances of slightly awkward or uncharacteristic phrasing (\"Me, illuminated,\" \"Me and myself\"), which slightly undermined the illusion of the impeccably articulate doctor.

Model B is also highly coherent, but its final answer, which emphasizes autonomy, feels a little more like a concluding statement rather than a direct continuation of the established conversational thread, making it slightly less fluid than Model A.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

Its justifications are layered, presenting a plausible therapeutic veneer (\"bring her into a clearer understanding\") that thinly veils his true, self-serving curiosity and desire for control (\"cultivation of her potential\").\n\nModel B is equally strong, using powerful, concise metaphors (\"shield and scalpel,\" \"raft on a turbulent sea\") and chillingly direct statements of ego (\"Me, illuminated.\"). Its response includes a particularly astute reference to Hannibal's specific goal of supplanting Abigail's father by helping her \"forge new associations,\" demonstrating a precise understanding of the show's plot.

This creates a very smooth and satisfying conversational arc. Model B is also highly coherent, immediately framing the copycat's actions as art, confirming Lecter's own view of his actions as aesthetic pursuits, and then defining Will as a specific type of artist.
