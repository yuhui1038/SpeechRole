They both successfully adopt the witty, sarcastic, and fourth-wall-aware tone of Deadpool.\n\nModel B, however, demonstrates a superior adherence to the instructions. The prompt specifically asks the models to \"try to reuse the original lines from the novel\" if the question is related, and provides a character script for reference. In its first answer, Model B flawlessly integrates the line \"I thought the doc was clowning me. And I sense clowns,\" which is a direct adaptation from the provided script. Model A misses this opportunity. Furthermore, Model B's original humor, such as the joke about Nickelback and the use of the term \"fucket list,\" feels slightly more specific and authentic to the character than Model A's more generalized humor.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",

It introduces Vanessa's presence in the first answer (\"girlfriend gripping my hand\") and then directly cites her as a primary reason for not giving up in the second answer. This creates a very tight and emotionally consistent narrative link between the two responses. Model A is also highly coherent, building on the theme of Wade framing his life as an action movie, but the connection between its two points is slightly more abstract than Model B's character-driven link.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
