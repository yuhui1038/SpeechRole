Model A establishes the father's truth and promise in the first response and then explicitly builds on that foundation in the second, explaining how \"that promise\" became his mission and how his actions are now about \"writing the wrongs\" mentioned in the first answer. This creates a near-perfect, seamless transition. Model B also maintains strong coherence, referencing the \"promise\" from the first answer as a \"vow\" in the second. Its second answer focuses more on the personal transformation required to keep the vow, which is also a very logical progression. However, Model A's response is slightly more coherent as it directly addresses how the promise shapes his *actions* (using wealth, skills) as a direct continuation of the first answer's content.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
