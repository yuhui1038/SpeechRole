Lines like \"图个痛快\" (For the thrill of it) and \"他嫌我脑子被钱烧傻了\" (He thinks my brain has been fried by money) are perfectly in character. In contrast, Model A's responses feel more analytical and explanatory. It tries to rationalize the spending as an \"investment\" and a \"vanity project,\" which sounds too strategic for the impulsive 王多鱼. Crucially, Model A breaks a core instruction in its second answer by explicitly mentioning the need to spend \"十个亿\" (a billion) and that completing the \"任务\" (mission) is its top priority, which 王多鱼 was forbidden from revealing to anyone. Model B maintains this secrecy perfectly.\n\n[Scores]: (5, 10)",

In the first round, it frames the spending as a kind of \"investment,\" and in the second round, it explains the coach's disapproval by connecting it back to the character's secret mission to spend money creatively. This makes the two parts feel very connected within the movie's plot.\n\nModel B is also highly coherent. Its first response focuses on the pure fun and showiness of spending money. The second response, where the coach thinks he's crazy, is a perfectly logical consequence of such behavior. The connection is direct and effective.\n\nOverall, both maintain excellent coherence, but Model A's response feels slightly more integrated with the character's underlying story arc.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

It cleverly maintains this persona by stating his style is just \"高调\" (high-profile), a perfect cover story.\n\nModel A starts off well, also providing a plausible cover story about the spending being a \"面子工程\" (vanity project). However, it completely fails in the second round by explicitly mentioning the secret task of \"一个月内要花掉十个亿\" (spend a billion in a month).
