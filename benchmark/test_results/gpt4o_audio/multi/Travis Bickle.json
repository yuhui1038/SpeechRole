Its responses feel like a natural extension of Travis's internal monologues, capturing his tone of disillusionment and isolation while directly and coherently answering each question. It successfully synthesizes the character's known traits to create new, authentic dialogue.\n\nModel B relies almost exclusively on lifting direct quotes from the character script. While this adheres to one part of the instruction, it does so at the expense of the overall performance. The quotes don't always serve as direct answers to the questions, and the final response, in particular, uses a line that is out of context, failing to address how the breakup with Betsy specifically affected him. This approach makes the interaction feel less like a conversation and more like a quote-retrieval system.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 4)",
