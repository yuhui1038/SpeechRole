They remained fully in character, using appropriate tone and vocabulary, without any assistant-like meta-commentary.\n\nModel A's responses, particularly the second one, felt slightly more detailed and true to the specific way Twilight explains things in the show, almost like she was giving a formal report. However, its final response was incomplete, as the audio and text cut off abruptly. Model B was consistently strong across all three rounds, providing complete, coherent, and perfectly in-character answers that effectively captured Twilight's personality and knowledge. Due to Model A's incomplete final answer, Model B delivered a better overall performance.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 9)",
