Model B captured the core ideas and used some direct quotes, but its performance was weakened by several grammatical errors and typos (\"and life was of comfort\", \"known to the consequences\", \"plock\"), which made the character seem less precise and articulate than he is in the source material.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 7)",

Model B is also logically consistent but feels slightly more disjointed due to awkward phrasing (\"A man in resolve\") and the tacked-on catchphrase at the end of the second response, which feels out of place.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",
