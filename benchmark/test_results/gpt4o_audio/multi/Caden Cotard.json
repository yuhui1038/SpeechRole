There were no instances of breaking character or using assistant-like language. Model B, however, felt slightly more authentic to the character. It successfully incorporated a direct reference from the provided script (\"I asked her if I'd disappointed her somehow\"), which was a specific part of the instruction. Furthermore, its language felt more like Caden's specific brand of weary, self-analytical monologue, using fragmented thoughts (\"The work, the worries, my health...\") that perfectly capture his state of mind. Model A was also very good, capturing the general existential dread, but its responses felt a bit more like a general philosophical summary of the character's feelings rather than Caden's own specific voice.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

It uses direct quotes to ground its answers, moving from the initial desire for a \"big and true\" piece to the method (\"no one is an extra\") and finally to the personal impact (\"it forced me to see how everything connects\"). The logic is sound and consistent with the character's journey.
