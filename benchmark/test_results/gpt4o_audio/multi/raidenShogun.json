It effectively used lines that were either direct quotes or very close paraphrases of the provided script and in-game lore, which was a specific instruction. The addition of personal details, such as \"我没能见她最后一面\" (I couldn't see her one last time), added a layer of poignant authenticity that felt very true to the character's inner thoughts.\n\nBoth models perfectly adhered to the instructions, but Model B's more direct use of the source material and its subtly more personal and concise phrasing gave it a slight edge in capturing the character's voice.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",

The tone is more melancholic and the delivery feels softer and more emotionally vulnerable than what is typical for the Raiden Shogun's public persona.
