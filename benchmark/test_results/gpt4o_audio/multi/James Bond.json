For example, the weary disdain for the Admiral in the first round and the cynical humor in the third round are perfectly executed.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, presents a much flatter emotional profile. The voice is calm and measured, but it lacks the characteristic Bond edge. It sounds more like a generic, wise narrator than a specific character known for his charm and wit.
