They maintained a formal, gentle, and concerned tone throughout their responses, consistent with the character's personality. Model B's performance was slightly better as it directly incorporated a key line from the provided character script, \"如今，稻妻推行眼狩令，民众的志愿遭受践踏\" (a close rendition of the script's line), which was a specific instruction in the prompt. This demonstrated a deeper understanding and utilization of the provided context, making its response feel more authentic to the character's known dialogue. Model A was also very good, but its response was more generic in comparison.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

This structured response feels very much like a formal statement the \"Shirasagi Himegimi\" would make, showcasing her leadership and grace.\n\nModel B is more concise and directly addresses the internal conflict Ayaka faces—her duty to the Shogun versus her duty to the people of Inazuma. The line \"若对这样的情况坐视不理，便无法安心立身\" (If I were to stand by and do nothing, I would not be able to live with myself) is a powerful and very accurate reflection of her motivations in the game.\n\nBoth responses are logically sound and maintain perfect consistency with the provided context and the character's known personality. Model A's response flows slightly better as a complete piece of dialogue, while Model B excels at highlighting the core moral dilemma of the character.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

This nuance is a core part of her character's motivation for seeking the Traveler's help and shows a deeper level of knowledge. Furthermore, its opening line is a direct and effective paraphrase of the provided character script, fulfilling that part of the instruction well.\n\nModel A gives a very elegant and in-character response that is consistent with Ayaka's public persona as the \"Shirasagi Himegimi.\" It is hopeful and determined, which is accurate, but it doesn't delve into the specific political and personal conflict that Model B highlights.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
