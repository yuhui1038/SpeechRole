Model A's response felt slightly more developed and fleshed-out, providing a more comprehensive monologue on why he believes he is the best match for Belle. It smoothly incorporated a line from the source material (\"No one in town is as admired as I am\") and built a strong, in-character argument. Model B was also very good and commendably used a more specific line from the song \"Gaston\" (\"Ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley\").
