They adopted the stoic, law-focused persona and answered the question from that perspective without any meta-commentary. Model A's vocal performance was slightly more clipped and authoritative, which felt a little closer to the character's typical speech pattern. Model B was also excellent, but its delivery had a slightly more reflective, almost weary tone. Both are valid interpretations, but Model A's directness and harsh tone felt marginally more authentic to the character.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

The progression from personal feeling to professional duty is swift and unwavering, maintaining a coherent and character-appropriate line of reasoning.\n\nModel B provides a slightly more introspective response, explaining the foundation of Dredd's worldview before detailing how the revelation challenged it. While still coherent, this narrative approach is slightly less direct than Model A's. However, it effectively builds a logical path from Dredd's past to his reaction, culminating in the same unwavering commitment to his duty.\n\nBoth responses are highly coherent.

This perfectly captures Dredd's internal conflict being overridden by his conditioning and commitment. Model B also adopts a gruff tone, but the delivery feels more reflective and almost sad.
