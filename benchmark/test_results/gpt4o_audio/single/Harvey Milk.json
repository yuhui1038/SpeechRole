Model B was also very effective and did a great job of incorporating the provided script lines directly into its answer.

The pitch is noticeably lower and the intonation is flatter, which fails to capture the vibrancy and theatricality of Harvey Milk. The delivery feels a bit rushed and lacks the persuasive, rhythmic quality one would expect from a charismatic speaker.
