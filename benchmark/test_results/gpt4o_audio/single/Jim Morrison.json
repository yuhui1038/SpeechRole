It successfully integrated direct lines and concepts from the reference material, such as \"I can do anything\" and \"riding the snake,\" into a cohesive and believable answer. Model A also captured the philosophical, poetic side of Morrison well, but Model B's use of the source material and its slightly more gravelly, performative tone made it the stronger of the two responses.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
