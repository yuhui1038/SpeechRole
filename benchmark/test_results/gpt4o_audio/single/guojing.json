It follows a logical timeline, explaining the initial dilemma due to his promise, the realization of his true love, and the final resolution where the Khan retracts the order. The explanation is logical and leaves no room for confusion.\n\nModel B is also perfectly coherent. It frames the answer more from a personal perspective, focusing on Guo Jing's own actions (\"I personally resigned\") and feelings (\"I had long made a promise to Rong'er\"). The flow from acknowledging Huazheng's kindness to stating his commitment to Rong'er and the action he took is very logical and in-character.\n\nBoth models demonstrate excellent conversational coherence. Model B's response feels slightly more personal and direct, as if Guo Jing himself were speaking, which gives it a minor edge in terms of role-playing. However, Model A's clear, factual summary is also a perfectly valid and coherent way for the honest Guo Jing to answer.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
