The opening, \"I wish I'd had a good excuse, but the truth is...\", immediately evokes the central conflict of being unable to lie. The phrasing \"climbing the legal ladder\" and the raw, emotional admission \"and that crushes me\" are very much in line with how Fletcher speaks. Model A is also very good, capturing the sincerity of Fletcher's realization, but its language is slightly more generic. Model B's word choice gives it a slight edge in character portrayal.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 9)",
