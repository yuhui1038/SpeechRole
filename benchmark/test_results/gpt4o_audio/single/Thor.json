Model B, however, captures the specific voice of the character slightly better. It directly references \"Father\" and his lesson, and its description of the hammer's abilities feels closer to the way Thor would explain it. Model A's response is also very good, but its language is a bit more formal and self-reflective (\"a grievous blow,\" \"I emerged stronger\"), sounding more like a wise king looking back on his life than the slightly more brash and direct Thor from the film *Ragnarok*.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

Model B is more direct, pulling key phrases almost verbatim from the source material to explain the hammer's function and the lesson learned from Odin.
