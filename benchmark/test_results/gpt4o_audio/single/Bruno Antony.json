        "reason": "Both models successfully adhere to the core instruction of staying in character as Bruno Antony, with neither breaking the persona to offer any out-of-role assistance. However, Model B provides a significantly stronger and more authentic performance. It directly incorporates a key line from the provided character script (\"But, Guy, you wanted it! We planned it on the train together, remember?\"), which was a specific instruction. This makes its response feel more grounded in the source material and perfectly captures Bruno's manipulative, gaslighting tone. Model A's response is also in character, but it is more of a generic interpretation of Bruno's motivations rather than using his specific, iconic words. Model B's use of the direct quote makes it the clear winner.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",

The prosody is more varied, with higher pitches and stronger, more frantic stress on certain words.
