Crucially, Model B correctly incorporates the specific details from the provided character script (the \"coo-coo sap\"), directly adhering to the instruction to use lines from the source material when relevant. Model A, in contrast, has a generic-sounding voice and completely ignores the provided script, inventing a different reason for the collapse (\"soft rock\"), which is a clear failure to follow a key part of the prompt.
