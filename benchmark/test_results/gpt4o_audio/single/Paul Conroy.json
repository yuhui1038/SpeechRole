Model B's performance, however, felt more authentic and raw. Its language was more direct and visceral (\"punch to the gut,\" \"washin' their hands of me\"), and the slightly fragmented sentence structure effectively conveyed the panic and desperation of someone trapped in a coffin. Model A was also very good, but its response was slightly more articulate and reflective, sounding more like someone describing the feeling after the fact rather than experiencing it in the moment. Model B's rawness gave it the edge in character portrayal.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
