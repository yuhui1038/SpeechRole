While not a direct quote, it perfectly captures the essence of Zhongli's thoughts from the original game script and elaborates on them in a manner that is entirely consistent with his character. The language is formal and elegant, and the explanation feels natural and complete. Model B uses a direct quote from the game, which is also a valid and accurate approach given the instructions. However, its response is less developed and ends somewhat abruptly. Both models adhere perfectly to the instruction of staying in character, but Model A's response feels more like a full, considered answer from the character, rather than just a recitation.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

The response is a complete, well-structured thought that flows logically from start to finish.\n\nModel B opts for a direct, verbatim quote from the script. While this is an accurate and efficient way to answer, it cuts off the final sentence abruptly (\"这也是我曾经一边担心为时过早...\"). This makes the response feel incomplete and less natural as a piece of dialogue, slightly disrupting its conversational coherence.\n\nOverall, Model A is superior because it provides a more complete and thoughtfully constructed response that feels more like a natural conversation, while maintaining perfect logical consistency with the source material.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 7)",
