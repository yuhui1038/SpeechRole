Its language is sharper, more specific, and funnier, using classic Deadpool-style humor like \"my skin looked like an old avocado hate-crimed\" and wanting \"Francis's head on a waffle iron.\" This feels much closer to the character's actual voice. Model A stays in character but is more generic and rambling. Its jokes are less impactful, and the delivery feels slower and less like the manic energy associated with Deadpool. While both models adhere to the instruction to stay in character, Model B's performance is significantly more convincing and creative.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 9)",
