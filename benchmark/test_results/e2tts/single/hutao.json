The voice is energetic and playful, capturing Hu Tao's spirit perfectly.

The tone is appropriate for the character, and the response is well-structured and natural. It directly incorporates the script and reassures the user that the process isn't troublesome.\n\nWhile both are excellent, Model A has a slight edge due to its more dynamic voice performance and the inclusion of a classic Hu Tao sales tactic, which demonstrates a deeper understanding of the character's quirks beyond just the provided script.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
