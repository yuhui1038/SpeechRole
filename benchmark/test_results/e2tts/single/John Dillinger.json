It seamlessly integrated the line, \"We're here for the bank's money. Not your money,\" which perfectly answered the question while fulfilling the instruction to reuse lines from the source material. The tone was confident and charismatic, a perfect match for the character.\n\nModel B also delivered a very strong, in-character performance. While it did not use the specific lines from the script, it conveyed the exact same sentiment in a natural, conversational way that was entirely believable for John Dillinger. It captured his ethos of being against the institutions, not the common person.\n\nOverall, both were top-tier responses.
