Holmes would treat the solution as self-evident, a mere \"conjuring trick\" that is obvious to anyone who applies logic.\n*   **Vocabulary:** The language should be precise, articulate, and slightly archaic, true to the character. Words like \"ruse,\" \"deduce,\" \"conjuring,\" and \"preparation\" would be expected.\n*   **Content and Deduction:** The ideal answer would directly incorporate the explanation provided in the character script. It would logically walk through the steps of the deception—the feigned possession, the pre-broken tombstone, the adhesive mixture of egg and honey—presenting them not as a story but as a series of facts that led to an inescapable conclusion. It would dismiss the idea of \"magic\" outright in favor of calculated deception.\n\nFor example, a strong response might begin with a dismissive phrase like, \"Supernatural, you say? My dear fellow, one must not mistake theatricality for divinity. There was never any magic. Only conjuring tricks.\" It would then proceed to lay out the evidence as he uncovered it.\n\nA poor response would simply recount the plot points without the characteristic voice, or use overly simplistic, modern language, failing to capture the essence of Holmes's genius and eccentricity.\n\nWithout the actual model outputs, a final score cannot be provided.\n\n[Scores]: (0, 0)",
