This makes the reasoning clear and consistent with the character's established methods.\n\nModel B takes a slightly more sarcastic and metaphorical approach, first by reframing \"break in\" as an \"unannounced environmental inspection,\" which is a classic House-ism. The analogy of the patient's story being the book cover while the house is the actual book is clever and perfectly captures House's desire to uncover hidden truths. This response is equally coherent, using wit to deliver the same underlying logic as Model A.\n\nBoth responses are excellent and demonstrate a strong understanding of conversational coherence within the context of the character and the ongoing dialogue.

It started with a slower, more deliberate, and world-weary tone, as if stating an incontrovertible, sad fact of life (\"Houses can't lie. People do.\"). It then built into condescension before ending with a classic House tactic: making the conversation about his own pain and boredom to dismiss the questioner.
