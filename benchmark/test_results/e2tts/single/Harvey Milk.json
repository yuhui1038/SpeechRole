The delivery felt more conversational and authentic to the character, beginning with a reflective tone (\"Winning? That's... that's never been my strong suit\") before building into the passionate explanation. It felt like a genuine answer from Harvey recalling his past struggles.\n\nModel B was also excellent and hit all the key points. It used the provided script and captured the character's passionate spirit.
