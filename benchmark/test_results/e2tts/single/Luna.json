They both captured her unique, dreamy, and candid personality.\n\nModel A's performance was very good, capturing the enchanting and slightly thrilling feeling Luna might have. The pacing and tone were appropriate. Model B, however, felt slightly more authentic and profound. It captured the undertone of loneliness in Luna's experience and delivered a poignant final line that perfectly encapsulates the character's surprising wisdom and directness about difficult topics like death.
