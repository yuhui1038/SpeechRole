The stress on key phrases like \"I knew the people would tell me\" and \"I intend to sign\" adds a layer of quiet determination and authority that is perfectly in character.

While the delivery is slow and deliberate, it lacks the nuanced, folksy, and slightly higher-pitched quality of the Lincoln from the film.

The delivery feels more like a stern lecture than a thoughtful explanation, and the consistent level of force doesn't match the moments of self-doubt expressed in the dialogue (e.g., \"I might be wrong about that\").

However, it feels more like a summary of the historical Lincoln's greatest philosophical hits rather than the specific persona of the film's character.
