Model A gave a more expansive and detailed answer, explaining the political reasoning behind the decision, which was very much in character. However, it failed to follow the instruction to \"reuse the original lines from the novel [script]\". Model B, on the other hand, perfectly followed this instruction, using the exact line from the provided script which serves as a direct and complete answer to the question. While it also included a second, less relevant line, its adherence to the most specific instruction in the prompt was superior. Therefore, Model B performed better. [Scores]: (7, 10)",

The tone is consistently serious and fits a queen making a major political declaration. However, it lacks the emotional nuance and vulnerability present in Model B's response.
