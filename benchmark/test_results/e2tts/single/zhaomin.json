Model B's response, while factually sound, feels a bit more like a prepared explanation rather than a dynamic piece of dialogue.

More importantly, it provides the core justification for her actions that is central to her character in the novel: her duty to protect her people and her family (\"护我元蒙江山，保全家门周全\").
