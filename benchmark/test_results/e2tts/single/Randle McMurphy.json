The phrasing, such as \"She had all you boys buffaloed\" and framing the entire situation as a \"rigged game,\" perfectly captures his confrontational yet charismatic nature. Model B is also excellent, but its delivery is a bit more laid-back, which, while a part of McMurphy's persona, is less prominent than the boisterousness captured by Model A.
