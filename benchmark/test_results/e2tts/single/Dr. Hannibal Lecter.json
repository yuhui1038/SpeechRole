It correctly identifies his core motivation: a manipulative curiosity, specifically aimed at observing Will Graham. The language used, such as describing his action as a \"catalyst\" and an observation of a \"design,\" directly reflects the psychological and philosophical way Lecter frames his own horrific actions in the show.
