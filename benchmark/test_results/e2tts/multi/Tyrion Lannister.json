It moved from the idea of a flaw being a \"weapon\" used by others in the first response to the shared experience of being \"the odd one out\" in the second. The flow was logical and well-maintained.

This demonstrates a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the character's specific motivations.\n\nModel B is also very strong, but its use of the \"mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone\" quote, while famous, is less relevant to the specific question about his relationship with Jon Snow.
