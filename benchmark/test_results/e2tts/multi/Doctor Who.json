Model A felt like a blend of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors, conveying the deep-seated trauma of the Time War with a powerful, dramatic delivery. It excelled by directly incorporating a line from the provided character script (\"I couldn't save your world! I couldn't save any of them!\") and finishing with a signature catchphrase, adhering perfectly to the prompt's specific instructions. Model B was also fantastic, channeling the quirky energy and underlying sadness of the Eleventh Doctor with a very authentic vocal performance and cadence. While its dialogue was entirely believable for the character, it did not utilize the specific lines from the provided script, making Model A's response slightly more faithful to the complete set of instructions.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
