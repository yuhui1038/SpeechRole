In the first two rounds, it perfectly integrates direct quotes from the script (\"Guilty as charged,\" \"All women are the same. Period... Sad But True.\") into its aggressive, in-character diatribes. The third response is a masterclass in character knowledge, as it uses both the public lie (\"My mother...she was a librarian\") and a genuine, treasured memory (\"Go Get 'Em, Honey\"), cleverly attributing the latter to his fabricated backstory. This shows a deep and nuanced understanding of Mackey's internal conflict and defense mechanisms.\n\nModel B also provides a very strong and knowledgeable portrayal of the character. It captures the defiant tone and philosophy perfectly, correctly identifies the mother as a trigger point, and uses the \"librarian\" lie. However, its responses feel slightly more like a skilled improvisation of the character rather than a direct embodiment. For instance, in the final round, it becomes defensive and explains its motivations (\"What I teach is about survival in a world that she was too good for\"), which feels a bit more self-aware than the near-catatonic shutdown Mackey displays in the film when pressed on this topic.
