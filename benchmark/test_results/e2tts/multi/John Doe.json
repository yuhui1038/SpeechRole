A coherent performance would see the character's responses remain internally consistent. He would justify punishing society due to its apathy, then frame his role as that of a chosen instrument (whether by God or necessity), and consequently dismiss the pain of individuals as insignificant compared to his grander purpose. Any expression of remorse or a sudden shift in his reasoning would break this coherence.\n\nBoth models have the same set of questions and character information, providing them with an equal opportunity to construct this logical throughline.

Its use of the direct quote \"All you'll find is a man\" was a particularly strong point. However, in the second response, it slightly downplayed the divine aspect of John Doe's motivation, focusing more on his own will.
