While both models successfully stay in character, Model B demonstrates a deeper knowledge of the novel by referencing other characters by name (Peng Yingyu, Yang Xiao) and using phrasing that feels more genuine to the character's humble and self-aware personality. Model A is also good, effectively using the provided script, but its responses are slightly more generic in comparison and it repeats a core idea in the first two rounds. Model B's answers feel more like they are coming directly from the character's own thoughts and experiences within the world of the story.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",

This progression feels natural and consistent.\n\nModel A, while providing answers that are individually in character, suffers from significant repetition between its second and third responses. The phrasing \"我曾经有过这样的打算，因为我不擅长权谋\" is used almost identically in both turns, which disrupts the conversational flow and makes it feel less like a developing dialogue and more like a series of isolated answers to separate questions.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 9)",
