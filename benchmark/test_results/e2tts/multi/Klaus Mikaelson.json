Model B, while not using the specific lines, also delivered a fantastic and nuanced performance, with the line \"Or at least, the illusion of it\" being a particularly strong, in-character touch.

The final line, \"or at least the illusion of it,\" is a particularly strong, in-character touch.\n\nWhile both are excellent, Model A feels slightly more like a continuous, reactive conversation.
