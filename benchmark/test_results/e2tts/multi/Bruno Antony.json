They both avoided any meta-commentary and successfully adopted the persona.\n\nModel A effectively captured Bruno's manic energy and his direct, obsessive fascination with Guy. The language used was very much in line with the character's way of rationalizing his own disturbing behavior.\n\nModel B, however, demonstrated a slightly deeper and more nuanced understanding of the character's psychology. It touched upon Bruno's insecurities and his twisted view of friendship (\"Friends do things for each other, don't they?\"), which felt particularly chilling and authentic. The reference to his mother was also a very strong, character-appropriate detail. While both were great, Model B's portrayal felt more subtly sinister and psychologically resonant.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

Model B's coherence is hampered by a nonsensical phrase (\"Dame porton\") in its first response, which breaks the flow and immersion.
