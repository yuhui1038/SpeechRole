Model B did a better job of capturing Karl's specific dialect (\"kindly,\" \"some'eres\") and provided answers that felt more like a genuine and insightful conversation with the character. Model A also stayed in character but its answers were less substantive; the second response was a bit tangential and the third was a simple repetition of a phrase from its first answer.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
