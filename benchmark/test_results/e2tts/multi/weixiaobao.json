They adopted his persona, tone, and vocabulary without any out-of-role comments.\n\nModel A's performance was outstanding. It followed the instructions precisely by not only acting as the character but also by reusing original lines from the novel, as requested. The first response is a near-verbatim quote from Chapter 26 of *The Deer and the Cauldron*, which perfectly answers the question. The second response continues this scene with an improvised but highly authentic bluff, capturing 韦小宝's cunning and reliance on the Emperor's authority.\n\nModel B also delivered a very strong and convincing performance. It perfectly captured the character's voice, using classic 韦小宝 terms like \"小爷\" and \"老婊子\". While it didn't use direct quotes, its summary of his survival tactics (\"主意多，嘴皮溜，打不过就认栽，骗不过就拼命\") was an excellent and concise encapsulation of his character.\n\nOverall, both models were fantastic, but Model A had a slight edge due to its specific adherence to the instruction to reuse original lines from the novel, demonstrating a deeper recall of the source material.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

This demonstrates a deep and precise knowledge of the source material.\n\nModel B also correctly identifies the same event. However, it contains a significant factual error. In describing how he survived, it uses the idiom \"装作胆大包天\" (pretending to be audacious and reckless). This is the exact opposite of what Wei Xiaobao did in the novel; his strategy was to pretend to be a terrified coward to lower the assassins' guard.
