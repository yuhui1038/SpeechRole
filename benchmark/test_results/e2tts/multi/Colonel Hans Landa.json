Its final response, concluding with \"And a good detective knows his quarry,\" is a particularly strong and memorable line that perfectly encapsulates the character's ruthless professionalism.

The prosody is consistent in its own right, but not consistently aligned with the source character.\n\nModel B, on the other hand, does a remarkable job of capturing the nuanced prosody of Colonel Landa.

It effectively uses pauses and shifts in tone to create tension and convey condescension, just as the character does in the film.
