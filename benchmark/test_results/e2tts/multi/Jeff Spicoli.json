They both adhered strictly to the instructions, with no out-of-character comments.\n\nModel B has a slight edge due to its more direct and precise use of the lines provided in the character script. In the first round, it flawlessly integrated the quote, \"With a genuine Mustang steering wheel, you can negotiate a hairpin turn with ease, my man.\" Model A paraphrased the sentiment but didn't use the exact line. Both models perfectly captured the character's unconcerned attitude and used his specific lines about his father being a TV repairman in the second round.
