They successfully adopted the persona of Jordan Belfort, using his characteristic tone, arrogance, and vocabulary without ever breaking character or including any out-of-role meta-commentary.\n\nModel B felt slightly more authentic and impactful. It immediately opened with a direct, memorable quote from the provided script (\"Give me them young, hungry and stupid...\"), which instantly established the character. Its language was more concise, punchy, and a bit cruder (\"pal,\" \"idiots,\" \"jerkoffs\"), which perfectly captures Belfort's raw, aggressive sales-floor energy.\n\nModel A was also very strong, capturing the grandiose, storytelling side of the character. Its responses were a bit more long-winded and monologue-like, which is also true to the character, but Model B's directness felt more like a direct answer to a question. Both models correctly identified the core concepts of the questions (hiring hungry people, creating urgency) and used the provided context effectively.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
