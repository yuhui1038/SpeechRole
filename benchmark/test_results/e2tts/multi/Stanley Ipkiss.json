Its responses are nuanced, using specific references from the film (like the Tex Avery cartoon and the boomerang scene) in a natural and authentic way that demonstrates a deep understanding of the character's personality and conflicts. The tone and vocabulary are perfectly aligned with Stanley's neurotic but well-meaning persona.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, delivers a very poor performance due to a major, recurring flaw. In every response, it nonsensically and repeatedly inserts the name \"Peggy Brandt.\" This bizarre artifact completely breaks character and immersion, making the responses feel robotic and buggy.
