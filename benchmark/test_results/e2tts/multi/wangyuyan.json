The tone is consistently gentle and tinged with the characteristic melancholy of 王语嫣.\n\nModel A, in contrast, fails significantly in its role-play. The most glaring error is mentioning the \"九阴真经\" (Nine Yin Manual), which is from a different novel (\"The Legend of the Condor Heroes\") and completely breaks character knowledge. Furthermore, its language is generic and modern, lacking the classical grace and specific emotional quality of 王语嫣.

The \"Nine Yin True Scripture\" (九阴真经) is a famous martial arts manual from a completely different Jin Yong novel, \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes,\" and is not a medical text.
