Model A's performance was decent, but its phrasing felt slightly more modern and generically dramatic.

This progression feels very natural. Model B is also highly coherent, with the first response focusing on the personal, maternal shock, and the second broadening the scope to her political motivations.

The line \"Faith in prophecy and political expediency are not mutually exclusive, you know\" is a perfect encapsulation of Catherine's worldview and directly answers the user's question with the precise, shrewd intelligence of the character.

Its responses feel more like a series of distinct, powerful proclamations rather than a fluid conversation. For instance, the declaration in the second response that the motives were \"entirely political\" is a very strong stance that feels a bit less nuanced than A's answer.
