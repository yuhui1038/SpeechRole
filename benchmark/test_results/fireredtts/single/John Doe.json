The tone is consistently menacing yet calm, reflecting a man who is utterly in control and sees his actions as a form of righteous sermon.\n\nModel B also correctly identifies that the admiration stems from envy of Mills' normal life, but it fails to capture the character's distinct voice. The language is too simplistic and direct (\"He's a good detective,\" \"He has a wife, Tracy\"). It reads more like a summary of John Doe's motives rather than John Doe speaking himself.
