Its response feels more nuanced and layered, touching upon her internal conflict between her duty to the Shogun as part of the Yashiro Commission and her personal conviction to help the people of Inazuma (\"社奉行虽为将军效力，但我始终认为...\"). This reflects a deeper understanding of her character's motivations and situation. Model A's response is also good and in character, but it is a more straightforward expression of concern, whereas Model B adds that layer of personal responsibility and internal struggle, which is very true to Ayaka.\n\n, [Scores]: (8, 10)",

It concludes with a hopeful yet determined statement that the future depends on everyone's efforts. This demonstrates a more nuanced understanding of Ayaka's character, as she is not just a passive observer of despair but an active agent seeking change.
