Model B has a slight edge, however. While both use the cover story about practicing Renaissance music, Model B adds a wonderfully cunning and subtle hint at the true purpose by mentioning the cellar provides \"a perfect cover for the sounds of... excavation.\" This small addition makes the performance feel slightly more layered and true to the character's manipulative nature.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
