However, the answer feels slightly incomplete, as it explains the secret of the weapons but doesn't fully address the core of the question about his personal ambition (\"野望\").\n\nModel B also correctly explains the secret of the weapons, referencing the military treatise within. It then goes a step further by explicitly denying any personal ambition for power (\"绝无称霸之念\") and stating his true, selfless goal: to help his brothers restore the nation. This response feels more comprehensive and captures the essence of Zhang Wuji's righteous and unambitious nature more effectively, making for a more compelling and complete in-character answer.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
