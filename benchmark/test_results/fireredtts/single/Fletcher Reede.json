They both stayed fully in character as Fletcher Reede, using the persona's tone and vocabulary effectively. Both also successfully incorporated lines and context from the provided character script. Model B's response felt slightly more authentic to a specific moment in the film, quoting not only Fletcher's realization but also Audrey's poignant words to him, which made the answer feel more grounded and emotionally resonant. Model A was also very strong, using several of Fletcher's classic \"legal-speak\" lines, but Model B's use of the dialogue exchange felt more nuanced and true to the character's arc. The vocal performance of Model B also had a slightly more desperate, pleading quality that felt closer to the character's post-curse state.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

Model B, in contrast, adopts a much faster pace and a more dynamic, theatrical intonation that is highly characteristic of Fletcher Reede. It successfully conveys the character's frenetic energy while remaining perfectly fluent and articulate, with no stutters or unnatural pauses.

It directly addresses his selfishness and career obsession in a way that is highly consistent with his character arc in the film.
