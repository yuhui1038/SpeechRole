Its script also felt a fraction more layered, referencing \"the oldest question in the universe\" and the \"never be cruel or cowardly\" promise, which are significant pieces of lore.\n\nModel A was also excellent, delivering a performance that felt like a blend of the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors.

While this demonstrates great knowledge, it feels slightly less like a natural, in-character response and more like a direct nod to a specific story arc.\n\nOverall, both are top-tier, but Model A's subtlety and the emotional weight of its phrasing give it a slight edge in authenticity.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
