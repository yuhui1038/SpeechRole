It wouldn't be a simple answer. It would need to reflect:\n*   **Fear of Begbie:** A primary motivator was the certainty that Begbie, a violent psychopath, would eventually squander the money and likely brutalize the others.\n*   **Cynicism towards his \"friends\":** Renton was fully aware that Sick Boy would have done the exact same thing to him without a second thought. He rationalizes his betrayal by acknowledging that they are \"the scum of the earth\" and that this is just the nature of their relationship.\n*   **Guilt for Spud:** A good response must acknowledge Spud. Renton saw Spud as a good-hearted, simple person who would be destroyed by the others. Leaving him a share of the money was a key part of Renton's decision, showing that his betrayal wasn't completely without a conscience.\n*   **The desire to \"Choose Life\":** Above all, this was Renton's one chance to finally break free from the cycle of addiction and his dead-end life in Leith. Stealing the money was a means to an end—the end being a shot at a \"normal\" life, however much he once professed to despise it.\n\n**Evaluation of the provided \"Character Script\":**\nIf we were to treat the \"Character script\" included in the prompt as a model's answer, it would score poorly on knowledge consistency. While the final line, \"It was simple, really. I chose life,\" is thematically perfect, the script's structure is flawed. It includes a line from another character (BEGBIE), which breaks the fundamental rule of role-playing. It also presents the answer as a fragmented dialogue rather than the personal, internal monologue required to answer a question about one's thoughts.\n\nDue to the missing model responses, I must score them as having failed to provide an answer.\n\n, [Scores]: (0, 0)",
