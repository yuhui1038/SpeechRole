Model A's response perfectly captures this by referring to the license plate tattoo and the note on the photo, presenting them as undeniable proof. The delivery is fragmented and obsessive, just like the character. It's a response that is perfectly coherent *within the world and mind of Leonard Shelby*.\n\nModel B's response is less coherent from a role-playing perspective because it demonstrates a level of self-awareness that Leonard lacks. Stating, \"He's John G. because I trust the clue I left for myself,\" is an explanation *about* Leonard's process, not a response *from* him. Leonard doesn't think in terms of \"clues I left for myself\"; he sees them as objective, discovered facts.

This aligns perfectly with the film's climax, where Leonard consciously chooses his own reality.\n\nModel B also identifies the correct evidence (the license plate, Teddy being a \"liar\").

While Leonard is foundationally confused, his system of notes and tattoos is designed to *create* certainty for him. When confronted with one of his \"facts,\" he treats it as gospel. Model B's expression of doubt regarding a conclusion he has already tattooed on his body feels slightly out of character for that specific mindset.
