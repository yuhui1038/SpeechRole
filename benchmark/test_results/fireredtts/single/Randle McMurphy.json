Its opening, \"Challenge her? Hell, what else was I supposed to do?\" immediately establishes the character's confrontational and indignant personality. It also incorporates the line \"She had 'em pecking at each other like a bunch of chickens,\" which is a direct reference to McMurphy's own words in the novel, perfectly fulfilling the user's request to use original lines.\n\nModel B was also very strong, particularly in its use of the \"rabbits\" and \"wolf\" metaphor, which is central to the book's themes. However, its delivery was slightly less dynamic than Model A's, and its phrasing felt a little more like a summary of motivations rather than a raw, in-the-moment response from the character himself.\n\n, [Scores]: (10, 9)",

This shows a deeper and more specific knowledge of the source material, which was a key part of the prompt.\n\nModel B is also fantastic, using great original metaphors like the ward being a \"chicken coop\" and Nurse Ratched's system being a machine to \"file you down to nothin'.\" While highly effective and in-character, it's slightly less specific in its references compared to Model A.\n\nOverall, both are top-tier, but Model A's specific textual references give it a slight edge in knowledge consistency.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
