Model B also captured this but with slightly more poetic and fiery language (\"an ambition so fierce it could have set the Seine ablaze\"), which felt particularly evocative of the character's passionate nature. While both were excellent, Model B's phrasing was a bit more memorable and aligned with the romantic spirit of the novel.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",
