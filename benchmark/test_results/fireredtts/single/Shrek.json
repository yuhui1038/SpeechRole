Don't you dare tell him I said that!\" reveals a level of self-awareness and emotional vulnerability that Shrek doesn't exhibit until much later in the story. While he does eventually come to see Donkey as his best friend, he would not admit to feeling \"less lonely\" during the initial quest to get his swamp back.
