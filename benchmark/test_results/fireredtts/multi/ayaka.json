This created a more authentic and faithful portrayal. Model B's language was also consistently more elegant and aligned with Ayaka's formal and gentle demeanor. Model A captured the general essence of the character but did not utilize the provided script as explicitly, and its final response contained an odd repetition, slightly weakening its overall performance.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 10)",

It makes a significant and somewhat out-of-character leap by presuming to know what the Raiden Shogun \"truly wants\" and telling her to abandon her quest for Eternity.
