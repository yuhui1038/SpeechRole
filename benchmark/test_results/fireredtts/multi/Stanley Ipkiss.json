Model B provides accurate and well-informed answers that draw directly from the film's plot, but its delivery is more straightforward and explanatory. It lacks the distinctive nervous mannerisms that define Stanley's core personality, making it sound more like someone recounting Stanley's experiences rather than being Stanley himself.
