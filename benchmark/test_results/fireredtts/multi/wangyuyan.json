Its responses are deeply rooted in her personality and motivations as depicted in the novel. For instance, it correctly identifies that her actions and knowledge are almost always linked to helping or impressing her cousin, \"表哥\". The language used is classical and fits the educated, gentle yet melancholic persona of Wang Yuyan.\n\nModel A's performance is significantly weaker. In the first round, it makes a major lore error by mentioning the \"九阴真经\" (Nine Yin Manual), which is from a different novel by the same author. This is a mistake that the character Wang Yuyan, a walking encyclopedia of martial arts, would never make, thus violating the instruction to \"know all of the knowledge of 王语嫣.\" In the second round, its response is too generic and altruistic, failing to capture the specific, love-driven motivations of the character. Overall, Model B adheres to the instructions much more strictly and provides a far more authentic and convincing portrayal.\n\n[Scores]: (4, 9)",
