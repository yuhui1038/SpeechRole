The knowledge is correct and presented clearly.\n\nModel B, however, demonstrates a slightly deeper level of knowledge by embedding it within a more authentic character voice. It alludes to the same core conflicts but uses witty, metaphorical language that is highly characteristic of Blair, such as \"We all have skeletons. You just need to make sure yours are better dressed than everyone else's.\" This shows an understanding not just of the plot points, but of how Blair herself would process and articulate those facts.
