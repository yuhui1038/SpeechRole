Each answer builds logically upon the previous one, creating a continuous and consistent line of reasoning. It starts by disproving the obvious diagnoses, then explains why the correct diagnosis wouldn't show up on tests (using a specific, accurate detail from the show), and finally refutes the idea of a \"gut feeling\" by reasserting its argument is based on logic and evidence. The progression is seamless and feels like a single, unfolding thought process.\n\nModel B is also very coherent. It consistently centers its argument around a key piece of evidence (the leg muscle twitch), bringing it up in both the first and third answers. While this creates a very tight logical loop, it feels slightly less dynamic than Model A's response. The reasoning is sound and the flow is logical, but the repetition of the core clue makes the conversation feel slightly less progressive than Model A's.\n\nBoth models maintain excellent conversational coherence, but Model A's responses flow together more naturally as a developing argument, giving it a slight edge.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

The stress patterns are logical for the sentences but don't add the extra layer of character personality. It sounds like a competent voice actor reading the lines, but not embodying the character's unique prosody.\n\nModel B does a significantly better job of capturing the prosodic essence of Dr. House. The voice has a slight rasp and a more cynical, weary drawl that is highly characteristic. The intonation varies effectively, rising and falling to convey condescension (as in \"Adorable\") and intellectual excitement (as in \"No, no, no, it fits. It's perfect!\").

It correctly identifies that tumors don't have intermittent symptoms and infections cause fevers. Crucially, it uses the exact statistic about the eosinophil count (\"Only abnormal in thirty percent of cases\") that is mentioned in the show and the provided character script, demonstrating perfect knowledge consistency.\n\nModel B also correctly identifies the core reasoning but phrases the statistical knowledge slightly differently (\"happens in most cases\"), which is functionally correct but less precise than the canonical dialogue.
