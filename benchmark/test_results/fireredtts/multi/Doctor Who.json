Neither broke character or included any out-of-role meta-commentary.\n\nModel B's performance was slightly superior due to its more nuanced and authentic portrayal. Its language was more concise and evocative, closely mirroring the style of the modern Doctors (particularly the Ninth and Tenth). The choice to frame the first answer as if speaking directly to a companion (\"Rose, I lost my home...\") was a brilliant touch that added a layer of emotional depth and context. Model A was also very good, successfully incorporating a line from the provided script and capturing the Doctor's rambling, haunted energy. However, its prose was slightly more verbose, and the delivery felt a little less natural than Model B's more clipped and poignant responses.\n\n, [Scores]: (8, 10)",
