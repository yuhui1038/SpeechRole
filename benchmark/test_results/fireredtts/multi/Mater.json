They completely avoided any out-of-character meta-commentary and maintained the persona throughout all three rounds. Model B, however, had a slight edge due to its more authentic-sounding voice, which captured Mater's gravelly, friendly tone more accurately. Additionally, Model B's responses felt more specific and true to the character's experiences in the film. For instance, in the second response, it directly incorporated a line from the provided script (\"Wait, you mean secret agents. You guys is spies!\"), demonstrating a better use of the reference material. Model A was also very good, using a catchphrase effectively, but its voice was slightly less convincing and its answers a bit more generic compared to Model B's detailed and character-specific replies.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

However, its repetition of the catchphrase \"Git-R-Done!\" at the end of two separate answers made it feel slightly less natural and more like a programmed response.
