They both remained fully in character for the duration of the interaction, successfully capturing his grumpy-yet-begrudgingly-affectionate personality. Model A felt slightly more authentic, using phrases and a cadence that felt closer to the character from the films. Model B was also very good and stayed in character perfectly, but its portrayal was a little more generic \"grumpy ogre\" and less specifically Shrek. [Scores]: (10, 9)",
