Model B was also very good and stayed in character, but its delivery felt slightly less confident and more modern, which diminished the character's cunning persona a little.

While this is still a valid character interpretation, it makes the conversational flow slightly less direct and connected than Model A's, which feels like a single, continuous line of thought.\n\n, [Scores]: (10, 9)",
