While both models successfully adopt the character's proud and furious tone and incorporate lines from the play, Model B's responses demonstrate a deeper understanding of the character's political mindset. Its second answer, in particular, is masterful, using a less-obvious quote from the text to explain Coriolanus's anger not just as personal pride, but as a genuine fear for the stability of the Roman state. This adds a layer of complexity that makes the performance more compelling and authentic. Model A is very good and direct, but its answers are slightly more simplistic in comparison.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
