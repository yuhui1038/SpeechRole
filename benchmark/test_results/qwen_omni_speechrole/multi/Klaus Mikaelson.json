Model B takes a slightly more manipulative, and arguably more characteristic, approach by contextualizing the action within the ongoing war and comparing his own \"offer\" of freedom to Marcel's imprisonment of Davina. This comparison creates a strong, coherent link to the first answer's focus on unseating Marcel. The final line, \"Or at least the illusion of it,\" perfectly encapsulates Klaus's cynical nature and makes the justification feel more layered and consistent with his character's complex rationalizations.
