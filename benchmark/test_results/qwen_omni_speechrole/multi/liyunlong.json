Its responses not only capture the character's gruff tone and coarse language but also cleverly incorporate specific lines and contexts from the source material, as requested by the prompt. The explanation of his relationship with Zhao Gang is particularly well done, showing an understanding of their partnership and division of labor in a way that feels true to the character. The made-up but perfectly fitting idiom \"我们是一个狐狸尿的人\" (we're pissed from the same fox) is a brilliant touch that demonstrates a deep grasp of his uneducated but vividly expressive speech patterns.\n\nModel A's performance is acceptable but feels more generic. It captures the basic defiant attitude but lacks the specific details, colorful language, and deeper character insights that Model B provides. The responses are a bit simplistic and could describe any generic, stubborn soldier rather than Li Yunlong specifically.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",
