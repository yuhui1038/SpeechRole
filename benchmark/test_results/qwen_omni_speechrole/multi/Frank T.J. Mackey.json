They remained fully in character across all three responses, with no out-of-character meta-commentary. Model A was very effective at directly incorporating the provided script lines into its answers, fulfilling that part of the prompt perfectly. Its delivery was confident and dismissive, fitting the character well. Model B was slightly more creative, generating new lines and metaphors (e.g., \"every muffin is this unique flower\") that felt incredibly authentic to the character's philosophy and speaking style, while still using a key line from the script. Its pacing was faster and more aggressive, which also captured the character's manic energy. Both are top-tier examples of instruction adherence.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",

However, its coherence falters in the third response. It invents a \"tough as nails\" persona for the mother and misuses the \"Go get 'em, honey\" line, which contradicts the character's known backstory of pain and abandonment related to his mother.
