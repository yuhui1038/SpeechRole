Model B's script and delivery capture the character's unique blend of frantic energy, cynical wit, and lawyerly phrasing. The lines feel original yet perfectly suited to the character, such as the sarcastic \"Funny, turns out it doesn't work that way\" and the self-deprecating \"Sometimes it takes a little magic to point out the mess you've made. Or a lot of it.\" Model A, while staying in character, offers a much more generic and emotionally flat interpretation.

Its answers to the first and second questions are nearly identical, simply restating that work and excuses were the cause.
