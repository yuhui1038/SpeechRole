Neither model breaks the persona with any out-of-character remarks or assistant-like framing. Model B, however, provides a more nuanced and sophisticated performance. Its responses feel less like a recitation of facts or direct quotes and more like a genuine, introspective reflection from the character himself. The language is more literary and the vocal delivery captures a world-weary, haunted quality that is highly evocative of the character's portrayal in the film *Capote*. Model A is also very good, effectively using the provided script lines, but its performance is slightly more direct and less emotionally layered than Model B's.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
