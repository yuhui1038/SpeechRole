Lines like \"Honesty is the best policy. Except for when it's not, but mostly it is\" and \"I tell them everything's fine, and then I figure out how to make it fine\" sound like they could have been pulled directly from the show. Model A, while staying in character, provided more generic and less nuanced responses.
