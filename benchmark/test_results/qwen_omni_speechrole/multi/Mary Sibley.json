However, Model B provided a significantly more convincing and immersive performance. The writing was more poetic and captured the character's cunning and world-weariness with greater depth (\"My life course was set by those who would see me weak. I simply steered the storm\"). Critically, the vocal performance of Model B was far superior, adopting a lower, more deliberate, and formal tone that felt authentic to a powerful woman in the 17th century and was a much closer match to the character from the show. Model A's writing was good, but its vocal delivery was too modern and lacked the specific gravity and menace of Mary Sibley.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",

This creates a powerful and logical progression of thought.
