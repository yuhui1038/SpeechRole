Its use of Landa's specific speech patterns, such as starting a response with a thoughtful, almost dismissive question (\"Respect? Perhaps.\"), felt incredibly true to the character. It integrated lines and concepts from the film seamlessly, sounding like a natural extension of the on-screen persona.\n\nModel B was also excellent and captured the character's intellectual and manipulative nature. It cleverly incorporated a different one of Landa's famous lines in its final response. However, its use of the word \"Absolutely\" felt slightly too direct and agreeable for a character who is typically more measured and coy in his concessions. It was a very minor detail, but it made the performance feel just a fraction less nuanced than Model A's.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
