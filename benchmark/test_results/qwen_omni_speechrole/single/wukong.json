Model B's response felt slightly more authentic to the character. Its use of \"俺老孙\" is a classic and distinctive phrase for 悟空, and its explanation of the events—from being named 弼马温 to later proclaiming himself 齐天大圣—is more chronologically accurate to the novel. Model A was also very good, capturing the defiant tone, but Model B's choice of words and narrative accuracy were slightly superior.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
