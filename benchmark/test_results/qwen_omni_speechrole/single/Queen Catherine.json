Model A used a direct quote, but it was from a different context (justifying Colin's murder after the plot failed, not the motivation for the plot itself). Model B, while not using a direct quote, perfectly articulated Catherine's core motivation: protecting her son and her kingdom by treating others as pawns in a larger game. Model B's language (\"pawn,\" \"game of life, death and thrones,\" \"alliance dangerous to my son\") is more evocative of the character and directly answers the question with greater depth.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 10)",
