While Model A used lines directly from the provided script, which was appropriate, Model B took a key line and expanded upon it with additional, perfectly in-character dialogue. This expansion (\"I only did what we discussed. You benefited, you're a free man now...\") demonstrated a deeper understanding of the character's manipulative logic and made the response feel more like a genuine, spontaneous answer from Bruno himself. The vocal performance of Model B also felt slightly more menacing and conspiratorial, which is a better fit for the character's dark nature.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
