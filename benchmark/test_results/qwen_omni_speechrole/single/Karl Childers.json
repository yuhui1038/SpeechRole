It effectively conveys Karl's simple yet profound emotional state. Model A uses a correct line from the film, but the rest of the dialogue is more generic. More importantly, the high-pitched, almost childlike voice is a complete mismatch for the character, which breaks the immersion and fails to adhere to the instruction of sounding like Karl Childers.\n\n[Scores]: (5, 10)",
