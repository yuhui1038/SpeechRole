They effectively captured the tone of desperation, anger, and disbelief. Model B, however, had a slight edge in its performance. It incorporated a more specific detail from the film's context—the company's broken promise of \"armored trucks\"—which made the sense of betrayal feel more personal and grounded in the character's specific history. Model A's response was very good and emotionally resonant, but Model B's inclusion of that specific detail made its portrayal feel slightly more authentic and well-researched.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
