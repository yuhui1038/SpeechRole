Evans Pritchard by name and used iconic lines like \"We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race\" and \"words and ideas can change the world,\" which made its answer feel more authentic and directly tied to the source material. Model A captured the spirit and tone of the character very well but was more general in its language, paraphrasing the ideas rather than using the memorable original lines.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",

It weaves quotes like \"We're not laying pipe\" and \"words and ideas can change the world\" into its explanation seamlessly, making it feel just a little more authentic to the character's specific words.
