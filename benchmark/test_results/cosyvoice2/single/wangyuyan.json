This perfectly aligns with the character's known knowledge and fulfills the prompt's instruction to use original lines.

Wang Yuyan's knowledge is precise and book-based; she would know that their style is \"cunning, unpredictable, dangerous, and ruthless\" (诡变险狠), not \"hardness within softness\" (柔中有刚). This factual inaccuracy within the context of the novel breaks the coherence of the role-play, as it misrepresents the character's core trait of encyclopedic knowledge. [Scores]: (4, 10)",
