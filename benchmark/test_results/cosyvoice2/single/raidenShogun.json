It frames the experience as a profound realization about the terrifying nature of \"erosion,\" making her quest for Eternity a logical, albeit extreme, conclusion. The final line, \"那一刻的心境…便是通往「永恒」之路的奠基石\" (The state of mind of that moment... is the very cornerstone for the path to 'Eternity'), is a powerful and fitting summary.\n\nModel B's response leans slightly more into the personal, emotional aspect of the trauma. It explicitly names \"无力与悔恨\" (powerlessness and regret) as the driving feelings. The opening hesitation (\"哼，过去的旧事…罢了\") is a wonderful character touch, and framing Eternity as her \"answer to Makoto... and all the departed\" is incredibly poignant and equally true to the character's motivations.\n\nBoth responses are perfectly coherent and demonstrate a deep understanding of the character. They simply choose to focus on different, yet complementary, facets of Ei's psyche: Model A on the philosophical resolve, and Model B on the personal, emotional wound.
