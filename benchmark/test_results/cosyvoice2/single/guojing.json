While not a direct quote, it accurately summarizes the events and 郭靖's feelings regarding the situation.

While Guo靖 is righteous, he felt immense guilt and sorrow for hurting Huazheng.

The phrase \"此事于心无愧\" (I have a clear conscience about this) doesn't fully capture the immense guilt and conflict that 郭靖 felt when breaking the engagement.
