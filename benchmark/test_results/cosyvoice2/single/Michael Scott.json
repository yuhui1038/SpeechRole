It also added a very in-character \"paperweight\" analogy and a classic \"That's what she said,\" making the entire response feel authentic and logically connected to the character's known thought patterns.\n\nModel B also successfully used a key line from the script and created a wonderfully convoluted and hilarious Titanic metaphor to describe the situation. This analogy is a perfect example of how Michael's mind works, and the line \"That's what a manager does. He manages\" is a quintessential Michael Scott tautology. The response was entirely coherent and flowed logically from Michael's perspective.\n\nBoth models are excellent, but Model A sticks slightly closer to the provided context by using more of the specific lines, making its response feel like a direct and coherent extension of the scene itself.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
