The voice of Model B captures the regal, dismissive, and calculating tone of the character perfectly, using sophisticated phrasing like \"one does what one must\" and \"a means to an end\" that feels true to her dialogue in the show. Model A's response is factually correct regarding the character's motivation, but the delivery is flatter and the language is more simplistic. It explains the reasoning but lacks the powerful, imperious persona that Model B embodies so well.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 9)",

The phrasing \"ruin any girl\" and the concluding, condescending question, \"Do you understand now?\" perfectly capture Catherine's sharp and imposing conversational style.

The flow from the political to the personal is very authentic to Catherine's mindset.
