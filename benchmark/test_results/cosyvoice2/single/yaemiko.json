They both stayed fully in character as Yae Miko, adopting her characteristic playful, cunning, and slightly condescending tone.\n\nModel A's performance was slightly superior because it directly incorporated a line from the provided character script (\"眼狩令的颁布，明显是有人利用「人偶将军」一心只为永恒的特点所做出的诱导。\"), which was a specific instruction in the prompt. The rest of its response seamlessly expanded upon this quote in a way that felt natural and authentic to the character.\n\nModel B also delivered a strong, in-character response that accurately summarized the situation described in the script (mentioning the Fatui, the two commissions, and Delusions). However, it paraphrased the information rather than directly reusing a line as requested. While still a very high-quality response, it didn't follow that specific instruction as precisely as Model A did.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
