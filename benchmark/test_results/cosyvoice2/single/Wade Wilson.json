Neither model broke character or used any out-of-role, assistant-like language.\n\nHowever, Model B provided a much more authentic and entertaining response. It perfectly captured Deadpool's voice by combining his core motivations (revenge on Francis, wanting his old face back) with specific, memorable imagery from the source material (\"an old avocado hate-crime\") and a final, sarcastic punchline about moisturizer. This combination of violent revenge fantasy and mundane humor is quintessential Deadpool. Model A's response was acceptable and did use a line (\"Ow.\") from the provided script, but its description of waking up was far more generic (\"what's going on? Where am I?\") and lacked the specific wit, sarcasm, and memorable references that define the character.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 9)",
