Model A was particularly effective, capturing the raw, panicked, and incredulous reaction from the exact moment in the film when Paul is fired. Its delivery was frantic and desperate, using dialogue that felt lifted directly from the source material, which perfectly matched the prompt's instructions. Model B also gave a strong in-character performance, but its response felt more like a retrospective summary of the betrayal rather than the immediate, in-the-moment reaction that Model A delivered. While still effective, Model A's immediacy and use of near-direct quotes made it slightly more impactful and aligned with the prompt.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

Model B offers a much smoother, more polished, and clearly articulated delivery. The pacing is more measured and resigned. It is technically more fluent in a traditional sense, with no stutters or breaks. However, this measured tone feels less like an immediate, panicked reaction and more like a weary reflection after the fact.

It correctly references other key grievances, such as the company's broken promise of armored trucks. However, its tone is more reflective and narrative (\"It felt like another punch to the gut...\"). It's Paul explaining the feeling after having a moment to process it, rather than living through the shock itself.
