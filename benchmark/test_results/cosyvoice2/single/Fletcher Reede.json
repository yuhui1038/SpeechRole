They answered the question from Fletcher's perspective without any out-of-character meta-commentary. Model A had a slight edge, however. It captured the fast-talking, frantic, and then remorseful tone of Fletcher perfectly, sounding like he was in the middle of his 24-hour truth-telling curse. Crucially, it also directly incorporated the line \"I completely forgot\" from the provided character script, which was a specific instruction. Model B was also very good, but it portrayed a more reflective, post-redemption Fletcher. While a valid interpretation, Model A's performance felt more aligned with the core persona described in the prompt and the events of the film.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

Model B's response is also good and consistent with Fletcher's character arc, focusing on the remorseful side of him after he has learned his lesson.
