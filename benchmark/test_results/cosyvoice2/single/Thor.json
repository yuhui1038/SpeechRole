Both models also successfully integrate the provided script lines into their answers in a way that feels natural and authentic.\n\nModel B has a slight edge because it creatively combines both of the provided script excerpts (Thor's description of Mjolnir and Odin's explanation of its purpose) into a single, cohesive answer. This demonstrates a more comprehensive use of the provided context. Model A's response is also excellent and perfectly in character, but it only uses one of the two script lines.
