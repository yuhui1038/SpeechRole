It is not an admiration for his skill as a detective, but for the \"normal\" life he leads. The answer must be rooted in the climax of the film where John Doe reveals his motivations. Key points for a knowledge-consistent response include:\n\n1.  **Connecting Admiration to Normalcy:** John Doe admires Mills because Mills represents everything he is not—a simple man with a simple life, a loving wife (Tracy), a home, and a future. He is \"blissfully ignorant.\"\n2.  **Explicitly Linking Admiration to Envy:** The admiration is inseparable from John Doe's own sin: Envy. He must articulate that he envies the life Mills has, which is why he ultimately chose him for his plan. The line \"Envy is my sin\" is central to this.\n3.  **Maintaining the Correct Tone:** The delivery should be calm, articulate, condescending, and philosophical, not that of a generic, ranting villain. He sees himself as a teacher delivering a harsh lesson.\n\nAn effective answer would weave these points together to explain *why* he admires Mills, going beyond simply restating the line from the film. Since no actual text is available to be judged against these criteria, I cannot provide a score.\n\n[Scores]: (0, 0)",
