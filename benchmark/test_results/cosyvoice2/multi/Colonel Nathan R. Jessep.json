Model A was slightly more impressive due to its consistency and originality. It crafted new dialogue that perfectly matched Jessep's arrogant, dismissive, and escalating tone across all three rounds. Model B started excellently by correctly identifying and using a line from the provided script, but its final response included a misattributed line (\"roll the dice and take your chances\") which, while a famous quote from the film, was not spoken by Jessep.
