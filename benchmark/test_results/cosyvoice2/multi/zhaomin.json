The final answer provides a pragmatic justification for her ruthlessness, explaining it as a necessary tactic for survival. This creates a cohesive and developing line of reasoning throughout the conversation.\n\nModel A, in contrast, starts with a less accurate premise of \"revenge,\" which isn't the primary motivation for Zhao Min's actions at Wan'an Temple.

The responses feel more like isolated declarations of pride rather than a connected argument.
