Model B is slightly superior in its coherence because its two responses more accurately mirror the central narrative arc of Salieri's experience in the film. The first response establishes the shock of seeing the vulgar man, and the second response perfectly captures the subsequent, contradictory awe upon hearing his music. This creates a more powerful and cohesive narrative across the two rounds. [Scores]: (9, 10)",
