It effectively uses the coarse, assertive language characteristic of Li Yunlong, including the classic self-referential term \"老子\" (Laozi). Crucially, Model B masterfully incorporates a direct, iconic quote from the novel (\"全团就我一个被降级...你还让不让我活了呀？\") which fits the question perfectly. Its explanation of the dynamic with Zhao Gang is also far more in character, capturing their \"division of labor\" relationship.\n\nModel A's performance is less convincing. While it maintains the persona, its language is somewhat generic and lacks the specific flavor of Li Yunlong's speech. For instance, stating \"他是我的上级，我是他的下属\" (He is my superior, I am his subordinate) is too formal and direct for Li Yunlong. Model B's depiction is simply more vivid, accurate, and faithful to the source material.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",
