They successfully captured his sadistic, arrogant, and darkly humorous tone.\n\nModel A's performance felt slightly more layered, incorporating a subtle admission of underestimating Jason (\"or so I thought\") and referencing deeper lore (\"bastard son of a hundred maniacs\"). This added a bit more depth to the characterization. Model B was also excellent, delivering sharp, classic Freddy-style insults and creative metaphors (\"a big, stupid can-opener for the can of fear\"). Both models effectively used lines from the provided script and concluded powerfully.
