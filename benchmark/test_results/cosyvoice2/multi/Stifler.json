They remained fully in character across both rounds, with no out-of-role explanations or assistant-like commentary. Both captured Stifler's loud, vulgar, and arrogant personality through their tone and word choice. Model A has a slight edge due to its inclusion of a specific detail from the film (\"Finch scores before him, and that dude uses the girls' bathroom!\"), which demonstrates a deeper knowledge of the character's world as requested by the prompt.

This contradicts Stifler's established immature, grudge-holding, and vengeful nature, creating a jarring disconnect between the two answers and breaking the consistency of the character role-play.
