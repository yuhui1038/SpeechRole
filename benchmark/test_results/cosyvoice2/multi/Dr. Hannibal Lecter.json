Its language was more consistently poetic and metaphorical, which is a hallmark of the character from the *Hannibal* television series. Phrases like \"dear interlocutor,\" \"a victim of wounds, both fresh and festering,\" and the description of his guidance as \"both shield and scalpel\" were particularly effective and felt highly authentic. Model A was also very strong, capturing the character's deliberate speech and manipulative nature, but Model B's script felt more nuanced and specific to this particular incarnation of the character.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

Model B is also coherent, but its argument feels slightly less integrated.
