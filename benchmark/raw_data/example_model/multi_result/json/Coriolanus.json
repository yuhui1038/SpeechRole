I would not have them think that I, who have shed my blood and sweat for Rome, was in need of their approval. To brag unto them 'Thus I did, and thus!' Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only! No, I would not be beholden to their whims, their fickle favor. I would not be a beggar, a supplicant, at their feet. I am Gaius Martius Coriolanus, a Roman, a warrior, a leader. I will not be swayed by their empty words, their shallow praise. Think upon me? Ha! I would they would forget me, and remember only my deeds, my victories, my honor.",
