narrator:FADE IN:
 INT. CHURCH
 We're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski. In attendance are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored teenagers. WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church. He speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit.
 OLDER MAN I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt. She was a real peach.
Walt Kowalski:「Thanks for coming, Al. Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953. Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge. Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.
 Jesus Christ. Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from across the pews.」

narrator:The choir sings the Beatitudes. Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish. FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife. Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak, unconvincing words of Father Janovich.
FATHER JANOVICH:「Death... is often a bittersweet occasion to us Catholics. Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased ... and their families. Sweet to those who know the salvation that awaits them. And some may ask, what is death. Is it the end? Or is it the beginning? And what is life? What is this thing we call life?」
Walt Kowalski:「Jesus. Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips. He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white cloth.」

narrator:INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
 The house is crammed with people following the service. Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to keep busy. Steve steps over to his father.
 STEVE A lot of people showed up after the service.
Walt Kowalski:「Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew there'd be plenty of ham. I think I'll go downstairs and get some more chairs.」
narrator:STEVE I'll do it, Dad.
Walt Kowalski:「Naw, we need them now, not next week.」

narrator:INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME
 Grandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in the cellar. A box of old Korea War photos are pawed through.
 Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are sprawled dead on the ground.
 DAVID Is that Dad?
 DANIEL No, it's Grandpa Walt. Josh turns the photo over and reads it...
 JOSH Third Platoon, E company, March second, 1952, Korea.'
 DANIEL Where's Korea?
 JOSH Hell if I know? David holds up a MEDAL.

 PAGE 5
 DAVID Cool, I found a medal. They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch, pretending to be doing nothing. Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.
 UPSTAIRS
 People eat and chat. Ashley marches over to her parents, KAREN and Mitch.
ASHLEY:「GRANDDAUGHTER) How long do we have to stay, this ghetto is a dead zone for my cell and I'm bored. Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs, he overheard his Granddaughter. Mitch and Karen are embarrassed.」
MITCH:「Ashley, honey. Why don't you help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?」
ASHLEY:「Me?」
KAREN:「Yes you.」
ASHLEY:「Grandpa Walt, can I help you with the chairs.」
Walt Kowalski:「I'll take care of it, you just painted your nails. Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window. It's snowing. Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks relieved to get out of the house.
 I'd better salt the sidewalk before someone falls and breaks a hip. Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his very, very, very old DOG follows him outside.」

narrator:Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk. He deliberately stops at the boundary of his property. The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged to Polish families. Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on. Walt can see through the window that the living room is jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong. And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full- blown, unrepentant racist. Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.
Walt Kowalski:「Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats can they cram into a living room? Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.」

narrator:Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a cigarette. She has pulled back the canvas tarp that covers his pride and joy, his beloved 1972 GRAN TORINO. The Gran Torino is in mint condition. It has been babied since the day it rolled off the line. Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt.
ASHLEY:「Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the vintage car? Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still burning cigarette before answering.」
narrator:WALT
ASHLEY:「I never knew you had a cool old car.」
Walt Kowalski:「It's only been in here since before you were born.」
narrator:CONTINUED)
 PAGE 7
ASHLEY:「So, what are you like going to do with it like, when... you die? Walt lights up a smoke --」
Walt Kowalski:「Jesus, Joseph and Mary. Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino.」
ASHLEY:「Then what about that super cool retro couch in the den, I'm going to State next year and I don't have, like, any furniture? Walt walks out without commenting.」

narrator:BACK IN WALT'S HOUSE
 The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door. Standing there is TAO, a sixteen-year-old HMONG boy. Walt scowls. TAO is slight, he has long hair, long lashes, but is very good-looking -- like an Asian Johnny Depp.
Walt Kowalski:「Who the hell are you?」
TAO:「very quietly) I'm Tao, I live next door.」
Walt Kowalski:「What?! Speak up, boy, get the shit out of your mouth. What do you want?」
TAO:「Do you have jumper cables? My uncle's car is old and...」
Walt Kowalski:「No. And have some goddamned respect, zipper head, we're mourning over here. Walt slams the door in Tao's face. Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich. Walt hates situations like this.」

FATHER JANOVICH:「How you holding up, Walt?」
Walt Kowalski:「Mr. Kowalski.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Huh?」
Walt Kowalski:「It's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.」

FATHER JANOVICH:「Right, Mr. Kowalski. Your wife and I became quite close these last few months. She asked that I watch over you when she passed on. I told her I watch out for my entire flock, but she made me promise I'd keep an extra sharp eye on you.」
Walt Kowalski:「I appreciate your kindness to my wife and now that you've spoken your piece, why don't you move on to the next sheep? Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was her wish for you to go to confession. She said she couldn't remember the last time you went.」
Walt Kowalski:「Is that so?」
FATHER JANOVICH:「It is. Walt drains his lowball glass.」
Walt Kowalski:「Well, I confess I never much liked church and only went because of the wife. And I confess I have no desire to confess to a boy who is fresh out of the seminary.」

narrator:People are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling, stiff-jointed old Pollacks. Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are more Hmong going up the sidewalk. They laugh and chatter and carry big dishes of food and fruit. They are a happy bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home. The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony. A three-day-old baby is named and three souls are located for the newborn.
 CUT TO:
 ANOTHER ANGLE Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables to their dead battery. Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window.
MITCH:「I'd really like to help, Dad, but we have to get the kids home, they're getting restless. Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance.」
Walt Kowalski:「Fine. Go.」
MITCH:「I'll call in a few, see how you're doing. Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off.」
Walt Kowalski:「Kill you to buy American.」

narrator:
MITCH:「Did you see him look at the truck? It's always Rice-Burner this or Jap-Buggy that. Even at Mom's funeral, he can't let it go.」
narrator:CONTINUED)

KAREN:「At least he didn't say anything this time.」
MITCH:「He didn't have to.」
KAREN:「Well, what do you expect? The man worked at a Ford plant for twenty- eight years.」
MITCH:「And I suppose that's my goddamned fault?」
narrator:BACK ON WALT
 Walt gets his guests' engine running. As they drive off, Walt hears faint SINGING. Walt looks into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes. The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their heads sliced off, right there in the yard. The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder. It's a sacrifice. Walt spits in the snow and says to Daisy.
Walt Kowalski:「Barbarians. Goddamned barbarians.」

narrator:Tao wobbles as he pedals his bike through the snow. Tao passes Walt's garage and is startled as Walt appears from a shadow, JUMPER CABLES in his hands. They make eye contact as Tao passes. Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy.
Walt Kowalski:「I thought these zips were supposed to be such hard workers. Christ, I had my own car when I was his age.」

narrator:SUPERIMPOSE: THREE MONTHS LATER Walt is going about the chores of spring cleaning.

 PAGE 13 Walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors' houses. Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors' houses are rundown. Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has installed a chicken coop. Walt looks down at Daisy --
Walt Kowalski:「Damn chinks let their yards go to hell. Polarski would turn over in his grave if he could see what they did to his lawn. Tao walks past. Walt watches him pass.
 I don't know why these goddamned slopes had to move to my block. This used to be a nice neighborhood.」

narrator:

Walt Kowalski:「Jesus Christ, dog, have you gone totally deaf? Walt opens the door. Standing on his front step is Father Janovich.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Hi there, Walt.」
Walt Kowalski:「Listen, son, you're not my barber, you're not a friend, so why in the hell do you think you can call me Walt?」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Sorry... Mr. Kowalski.」
Walt Kowalski:「So, what are you peddling now?」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Oh, nothing. Thought I'd drop by and see how you were doing. Haven't seen you in church in awhile.」
Walt Kowalski:「Okay. You've done your good deed, now why don't you run along.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.」

Walt Kowalski:「I don't think so, kid. Sorry.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Why? Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?」
Walt Kowalski:「You don't want to know.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「No, I do.」
Walt Kowalski:「The problem is I think you're an overeducated, 27-year-old virgin who holds the hands of superstitious old women and promises them eternity.」

narrator:Walt sits at the bar in the VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars) drinking with the old buddies and cracking off- color jokes.
Walt Kowalski:「I got one. A Mexican, a Jew and a colored guy walk into a bar, the bartender looks up at them and says -- get the fuck out.' The gang laughs, until they see Father Janovich step up to the bar. He smiles as he recognizes several faces.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「So, here's where my flock congregates when they're not in church.」

 MEL Hiya, Father J.
FATHER JANOVICH:「Hi, Mel. Hey there, Darrel.」
narrator:DARREL Hello, Father.
FATHER JANOVICH:「Hi, Walt. Walt says nothing. He just sips his beer.」
narrator:DARREL What brings you in here, Father? The meat raffle?
FATHER JANOVICH:「No. I came down to talk to Walt, if that's okay. Mel and Darrel look at Walt. It puts him on the spot.」
Walt Kowalski:「I have to hand it to you, Padre. You are persistent.」

FATHER JANOVICH:「I promised your wife. Walt looks over at Mel and Darrel and then back at Father Janovich.」
Walt Kowalski:「Oh Jesus Christ, let's grab a booth.」

narrator:
21:「The waitress comes over.」
Walt Kowalski:「I'll have a Pabst and a shot. What are you having, Father?」
FATHER JANOVICH:「I'll have a Diet Coke.」
Walt Kowalski:「Bullshit, this is a bar, what do you want to drink?」
narrator:CONTINUED:

FATHER JANOVICH:「Ummmm... I'll have a gin and tonic.」
Walt Kowalski:「Attaboy. The waitress leaves.
 So, what do you want?」
FATHER JANOVICH:「I promised your wife I'd get you to go to confession.」
Walt Kowalski:「Jesus Christ, why'd you do that?」
FATHER JANOVICH:「She was very insistent. She made me.」
Walt Kowalski:「You sure are fond of promising people stuff you can't deliver on.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Let's talk about something else.」
Walt Kowalski:「Like what?」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Life and death.」
Walt Kowalski:「What would you know about it?」

FATHER JANOVICH:「I'd like to think I know a lot. I'm a priest.」
Walt Kowalski:「You stand at the altar and preach on and on about life and death without knowing anything other than what you learned in priest school. Everything you say sounds like it's out of the Rookie Preachers Handbook.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「I don't know about that...」
narrator:CONTINUED:

 PAGE 22 Walt waves his hand and cuts him off.
Walt Kowalski:「Death is bittersweet? Bitter in the pain, sweet in the salvation.' That's what you know of life and death? Good God, it's pathetic.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?」
Walt Kowalski:「Plenty. I lived with death for three years in Korea. We shot people, we stabbed them with bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year- old kids to death with shovels, for Christ's sake. I did things that won't leave me till the day I die, horrible things, things I have to live with.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「And what about life? Walt has to think for a second. He struggles with his answer.」

Walt Kowalski:「Well... I survived the war... got married... and raised a family.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Sounds like you know more about death than you do living. Walt downs a shot.」
Walt Kowalski:「Maybe so.」

narrator:Walt hears a sound and wakes up. He's very groggy, he had plenty to drink at the VFW.
Walt Kowalski:「Daisy? The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at the clock; it's 3:48 am. Walt looks out his bedroom window. He sees the faint beam of a flashlight in his garage.」
narrator:CONTINUED: (2)

 PAGE 23
Walt Kowalski:「Son of a bitch. Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea. Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and chambers a round with a loud SNAP.」

narrator:The light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face to face with the barrel of Walt's M1 RIFLE. Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away. Tao drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud metallic clang. Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. As Tao backs up, Walt advances, step for step. Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip. They both start to fall. The lightbulb is bumped with the rifle barrel and swings back and forth. As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally FIRES THE RIFLE. The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer sign on the wall. Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over Walt. Tao runs out of the garage and into the night. Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned. Sweat runs down his forehead. He coughs up blood. The lightbulb still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage.
Walt Kowalski:「Shit.」

narrator:Walt drills heavy-gauge screen mesh over the windows on the garage. The phone rings and Walt answers.
Walt Kowalski:「Hello?」
MITCH:「V.O.) Morning, Dad, it's your number one son, Mitch.」
Walt Kowalski:「It's one in the afternoon. The CAMERA now INTERCUTS BETWEEN Walt and Mitch in the kitchen of his huge, modern suburban house.」
narrator:CONTINUED:

 PAGE 25
MITCH:「Right, good afternoon, then.」
Walt Kowalski:「So, what do you want?」
MITCH:「Me? Nothing. What would I want?」
Walt Kowalski:「I don't know. Your wife already went through all of your mother's jewelry.」
MITCH:「No. I was just wondering how you are, what's going on, anything new in the old neighborhood? Walt looks at the bullet hole in his Hamm's Beer sign.」
Walt Kowalski:「Nope.」
MITCH:「Great. Smooth sailing then?」
Walt Kowalski:「Yup. There's a very painful pause in the conversation.」
MITCH:「Well good... Say, Dad?」

Walt Kowalski:「Uh-huh.」

 PAGE 29 And before anyone can blink, WALT has the muzzle of his big 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle pointing at Smokie's face.
Walt Kowalski:「Get off my lawn.」
SMOKIE:「Listen, old man, you don't want...」
Walt Kowalski:「I said get off my lawn. Now. Walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers. The guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big military rifle Walt holds.」
SMOKIE:「Are you fucking crazy? Go back in your house, old man.」
Walt Kowalski:「Get off my lawn.」
SMOKIE:「I'm not fucking around, Gramps. Walt spits out the side of his mouth. He grins.」

Walt Kowalski:「Don't think for a second I won't blow a big hole in your face and it won't bother me a bit, not any more than if I shot a deer. Now get off my goddamned lawn. Two of the Hmong gangbangers take a step back. Walt senses their fear. Only Smokie holds his ground.
 Believe me, kid, I'll blow your damn head off, go back to bed and sleep like a baby. I couldn't care less.」
SMOKIE:「I'm not gonna warn you again! Walt laughs...」
Walt Kowalski:「You're nothing to me. In Korea, we stacked fucks like you five feet high and used you as sandbags.」
narrator:CONTINUED:

 PAGE 30 Complete silence, there's no sound anywhere in the neighborhood. All eyes are on Walt. Walt CLICKS OFF the safety on the M1 Garand Rifle. Smokie and the gangbangers give Walt fierce looks, but melt back towards their car. As they get into the car -- Smokie has to say something.
SMOKIE:「You better watch yourself, old man. The Honda screeches its tires and goes off down the street. Walt looks at Tao, Sue, Mom and Grandma who stand in stunned silence in his front yard. A PAUSE. Finally, Sue speaks up...」

SUE:「Thank you. Walt lowers his rifle and spits on the ground.」
Walt Kowalski:「I said get off my lawn.」

narrator:Walt looks around and slowly lowers his rifle. His front porch is covered with FLOWERS and FRUIT and GIFTS of food. There must be a dozen different gifts piled there. Daisy comes out and stretches on the porch, before putting her nose in a food basket.
Walt Kowalski:「Bad dog. Bad deaf, dumb, blind dog.」

narrator:
33:「Walt carries three big bouquets of flowers to the trash. He dumps them on top of other gifts he received from the Hmongs. His garbage is overflowing. Coming down the alley is another Hmong couple, they smile carrying a basket filled with Asian vegetables. Walt holds up his hand like a traffic cop.」
Walt Kowalski:「No. No more. The Hmong couple nod, say something with a smile and turn around.」
narrator:NEXT DOOR Tao, his mother and Sue argue in the yard. They gesture towards Walt's house. The women buzz around Tao, all speaking in his ear at the same time. Phong yells at them from the porch, but they ignore her. Walt watches as the mother and Sue march Tao towards his house. Tao looks like a whipped dog.
Walt Kowalski:「Why won't these people leave me alone? Walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts up his hands, indicating they've come far enough. Sue holds up a plant.」
SUE:「We brought you some shallots to plant in your garden.」
Walt Kowalski:「I don't want them.」
SUE:「They're perennials, they come back every year.」

Walt Kowalski:「No. You keep them. Why do you people keep giving me all this garbage? Sue is a little taken aback.」
narrator:CONTINUED)
 PAGE 32
SUE:「Because... because you saved Tao.」
Walt Kowalski:「No, I didn't. All I did was get a bunch of jabbering gooks off my lawn.」
SUE:「Well, you're a hero to the neighborhood.」
Walt Kowalski:「No, I'm not.」
SUE:「Too bad, they think you are and that's why they're bringing you the gifts.」
Walt Kowalski:「Just take your plant and leave me alone. Walt turns and starts to walk away. Tao's mother speaks rapidly in Hmong to Sue. They look at Tao and then to Walt.」
SUE:「There's another thing.」
Walt Kowalski:「What?」
SUE:「This is my mother, Vu, I'm Sue and this is my brother, Tao. We live next door.」
Walt Kowalski:「So?」
SUE:「Tao is here to apologize. Sue shoots a hard look at Tao, who shifts uncomfortably.」
TAO:「I'm sorry.」

Walt Kowalski:「For what?」
narrator:CONTINUED:

 PAGE 33
TAO:「For trying to steal your car. Walt's eyes go wide in recognition. He turns white with rage.」
Walt Kowalski:「Get this straight, I see you on my property again, you're done. Walt turns on his heels and storms into his house.」

narrator:
34:「The doorbell rings. Walt opens it to find Father Janovich standing on his front step.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Good afternoon, Walt. Walt's eyes narrow.
 I mean, Mr. Kowalski.」
Walt Kowalski:「I already told you I'm not going to confession.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Why didn't you just call the police?」
Walt Kowalski:「Pardon?」
FATHER JANOVICH:「I do work with some of the Hmong gangs and I heard there was some trouble in the neighborhood. Why didn't you call the police?」
Walt Kowalski:「Oh, I prayed for them to show up, but guess what? No answer.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「What were you thinking? Someone could have been killed. We're talking life and death here.」
narrator:CONTINUED: (2)
 CONTINUED)
 PAGE 34
Walt Kowalski:「Not that it's any of your goddamned business, but when things happen quickly like that, you have to react. In Korea, we never called the police' when a swarm of screaming gooks came pouring into our lines. We reacted.」

FATHER JANOVICH:「We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski. Walt says nothing.
 I've been thinking about our discussion on life and death. About what you said. About how you carry around the horrible things you were forced to do. Horrible things that won't leave you. It seems that it would do you good to unload some of that burden. Things done during war are terrible, being ordered to kill, killing to save others, killing to save yourself. You're right, those are things I don't know anything about. But I do know about forgiveness. And I've seen a lot of men who have confessed their sins, admitted their guilt and left their burdens behind them. Stronger men than you. Men at war who were ordered to do appalling things and are now at peace. Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost.」
Walt Kowalski:「I'm impressed. You came with your guns loaded, for once.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Thank you.」
Walt Kowalski:「You have balls, Father. And what you said, you're right. I'm sure stronger men than me have found their salvation. Hallelujah. But there's one thing you're way wrong about.」
narrator:CONTINUED:

 PAGE 35

FATHER JANOVICH:「What's that, Mr. Kowalski?」
Walt Kowalski:「The thing that haunts a guy is the stuff he wasn't ordered to do.」

narrator:The old, balding BARBER finishes cutting Walt's hair.
BARBER:「There, you look like a human being again. You shouldn't wait so long between haircuts, you cheap bastard.」
Walt Kowalski:「I'm just amazed that you're still alive. I keep hoping you'll die and they'll get someone good in here, but you just hang in there, you dumb, Italian-Wop-Dago, you.」
BARBER:「That'll be ten dollars, Walt.」
Walt Kowalski:「Ten dollars? Jesus Christ, Martin, you keep raising the price. You sure you're not part Jew? Martin the Barber laughs at Walt.」
BARBER:「It's been ten bucks for the last five years and you know it, you thick-skulled, old Pollack son of a bitch.」
Walt Kowalski:「Here's ten, keep the change.」
BARBER:「See you in three weeks, you prick.」
Walt Kowalski:「If you live that long, dipshit. Walt and Martin shake hands and Walt walks out.」

TALL BLACK GUY:「Hey, girl, you come over here and talk to me. Come on, baby, don't be shy. Trey and Sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can to avoid the black guys. They try to ignore them.
 Come on, sweetie, don't be like that. You talk to me, don't be all stuck up and shit.」
narrator:ACROSS THE STREET Walt waits at a stoplight. He watches Sue and Trey and the three black guys who block their path. One black guy flips Trey's VISOR onto the ground. The Tall Guy makes kissy faces at Sue as he touches his crotch. Walt sits there for a second; he shouldn't help, but Walt solves every situation by being aggressive. Walt drives off, then makes a U-turn. The Tall Black Guy now focuses on Trey.
TALL BLACK GUY:「What are you sposed to be? Trey puts up his hand to hi-five. The Tall Black Guy just looks at him.」

SUE:「What, are you gonna hit me now? That'd pretty much complete the picture. The Tall Black Guy pushes Sue hard against the wall.」
TALL BLACK GUY:「You don't know when to quit. The old, black pickup pulls up and stops next to them. Sue, Trey and the black guys look over. Walt sits behind the wheel, he looks right through the Tall Black Guy.
 What the fuck you looking at, old man?」
Walt Kowalski:「You... and your buddies. What's the matter with you? Don't any of you work? I see you lazy show- offs in the middle of the day, slowly walking across the street or harassing women. Nobody owes you bastards anything so go out and get a job instead of pushing little girls around, for Christ's sake.」
TALL BLACK GUY:「Why don't you get the fuck out of here, while I'll still let you.」

 But you might just be dumb enough not to recognize that your luck just ran out. All bravado drains away from the black guys. Walt is a rock. Walt grins slightly and spits on the ground.」
TALL BLACK GUY:「Fuck this guy. He ain't worth it. The trio walks slowly across the street, forcing a car to miss a green light. Trey puts his hand out to shake Walt's...」
narrator:TREY Man, thanks a lot, mister. Walt doesn't extend a hand, he lets Trey stand there like an idiot. Trey slowly lowers his arm. Walt looks at Trey's outfit.

 Come on, I'll give you a ride.」

SUE:「So, what's with you, you have some sort of savior complex or something?」
Walt Kowalski:「What in the hell's the matter with you? I thought all you Asian girls were supposed to be so smart. What are you doing walking around in that neighborhood? That's how you end up in the obituaries, that is, if they can identify your body once they pull it out of the goddamned river.」
SUE:「I know, I know. Take it easy. Walt looks at her for a second. She's not ruffled at all. They drive.」
Walt Kowalski:「So, that goofball back there. He's your boyfriend?」
SUE:「Yeah, kind of, his name is Trey.」
Walt Kowalski:「Why in the hell would you go out with a clown like that. Why don't you date one of your... own...one of those other... Hu-mungs.」
SUE:「You mean, Hmong? We're Hmong, not Hu-mung.」

Walt Kowalski:「Why'd you pick the Midwest, for Christ's sake? There's snow on the ground near half the year. Jungle people on the frozen tundra?」
SUE:「Hill people. We were hill people, not jungle people. Boo-ga, boo- ga, boo-ga.」
Walt Kowalski:「Whatever.」
SUE:「Blame the Lutherans. They brought us here.」
Walt Kowalski:「Still, you'd think the cold would keep all the assholes away. Sue laughs again at Walt's conscienceless racism.」
SUE:「Thanks for the ride.」

Walt Kowalski:「Sure... You know, you seem okay. What the hell's the matter with your half-wit brother? He a little slow or something?」

Walt Kowalski:「Oh, poor Toad.」

narrator:Walt drinks coffee and reads the newspaper. He flips from section to section. Daisy's at his feet. Next door, Phong sits watching Walt. He can see her mumbling under her breath.
Walt Kowalski:「Old hag, giving me the evil eye? Walt opens the paper to the TV guide section and lingers at the HOROSCOPES for a second.
 Aw, what the hell... Walt reads aloud to himself.
 Your birthday today; This year you have to make a choice between two life paths. Second chances come your way. Extraordinary events culminate in what might seem to be an anti-climax. Your lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and」
narrator:Walt drains his coffee and tosses the paper onto the porch.

Walt Kowalski:「Christ all Friday. What's wrong with kids today? Walt gets up to go help, but before he can get to the sidewalk, another neighbor has gone over to help... It's TAO. Tao bends down and carries her bags up to her door.
 Well, I'll be damned.」

narrator:

ALL the signatures have been written in a woman's cursive style and with the same pen. Mitch slides a wrapped gift across the table to Walt.」
MITCH:「Go ahead, Dad. Open it.」
Walt Kowalski:「What is it?」
MITCH:「Just open it. Walt opens the package, it's a Gopher Reaching Tool -- the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can pick up objects that have fallen behind the stove, etc. Walt looks at his son and daughter-in-law.
 It's a Gopher. It's so you can reach stuff. You know, it makes things easier.」
KAREN:「Here's one from me. KAREN slides over a another wrapped gift. Walt opens it. It's a PHONE with really big numbers for old people.」

Walt Kowalski:「We miss Momma, don't we, Daisy. A vehicle pulls up to Tao's house. A party is in full swing. Sue comes out and helps the Hmong women unload big platters of food and carry them to the house. Sue catches Walt's gaze and steps over to his porch.」
SUE:「Hey, Walt, what are you up to? Walt points his index finger at the can of Pabst in his hand.
 We're having a barbecue. You want to come over?」
Walt Kowalski:「What do you think?」
SUE:「There's tons of food.」
Walt Kowalski:「I'll bet. Just keep your paws off my dog.」
SUE:「No worries, we only eat cats.」
Walt Kowalski:「Really?」
SUE:「No, I'm kidding, you moron. Come on, come on over. You can be my special guest.」

Walt Kowalski:「Oh, what the hell. It's my birthday, I may as well drink with strangers instead of myself. Walt gets up and walks with Sue towards her house.」
SUE:「Happy Birthday, Wally.」
Walt Kowalski:「Don't call me Wally.」

narrator:Inside are thirty Hmong and Walt, who sticks out like a sore thumb. Total fish out of water. Walt looks in the refrigerator, Sue looks over his shoulder.
Walt Kowalski:「You do have a lot of beer, but no Pabst.」
SUE:「As they say, When in Hmong.」
Walt Kowalski:「Ha ha. Are you sure it's okay I'm here? Everyone keeps looking at me and when I look back, they look at the ground.」

Walt Kowalski:「What'd she say?」
SUE:「She said welcome to our home.」
Walt Kowalski:「No she didn't.」
SUE:「No, she didn't.」
narrator:PHONG
 SUBTITLED) Why is this white man in our home? A man like him brings nothing, nothing but sorrow and death. Several relatives usher Phong away from Walt. The relatives are embarrassed at the outburst.

Walt Kowalski:「She hates me.」
SUE:「Yes, she hates you.」
Walt Kowalski:「What did I do? A little Hmong girl walks past and Walt pats her on the head. Everyone in the room looks in horror at Walt.
 What?! What the hell are all you fish heads looking at?! Sue looks around and then pulls Walt out of the room.」

narrator:Sue explains a few facts to Walt.

SUE:「A lot of the people in this house are very traditional. Number one, never touch a Hmong person on the head, not even a child. Hmong people believe that the soul resides in the head, so don't do that.」
Walt Kowalski:「That's dumb, but fine.」
SUE:「Hmong people also consider looking someone in the eye to be rude. That's why everyone looks away when you look at them.」
Walt Kowalski:「Swell. Anything else?」
SUE:「Yeah, some Hmong smile or grin when they're yelled at or get into a confrontation. It's a cultural thing. It expresses embarrassment or insecurity, not that they're laughing at you.」
Walt Kowalski:「Good God, you people are all nuts.」

narrator:
45:「Walt opens another beer, as Sue speaks Hmong to a relative. Walt notices an Old Hmong Man staring at him. Walt interrupts Sue.」
Walt Kowalski:「Hey, Sue.」
SUE:「What?」
Walt Kowalski:「You said you guys don't look you in the eye, but that guy keeps staring at me. Sue laughs and gestures to the Old Hmong Man. The Old Hmong Man steps over and nods to Walt.」

SUE:「This is Kor Khue. He's the Lor family shaman.」
Walt Kowalski:「Witch doctor? Sue smiles and nods.」
SUE:「Something like that. The Hmong hold their clan Shaman in very high regards.」
Walt Kowalski:「Boo-ga, boo-ga. Kor Khue says something to Sue in Hmong. She turns and translates to Walt.」
SUE:「Kor Khue is interested in you, he heard what you did. He says he would like to read you.」
Walt Kowalski:「Huh?」

SUE:「He wants to read you. Tell you your soul. It'd be rude not to allow him this, it's a great honor.」
Walt Kowalski:「Tell Kor to be my guest, fire away. Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman. The Shaman responds and sits down across from Walt. He looks at Walt for a long time. Walt stares straight back at him. The Shaman mumbles to himself. Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly. As Sue translates, the Shaman watches Walt's reaction.」
SUE:「Kor Khue says that you think you've been disrespected. You do not live your life. Your food has no flavor. You are scared of your past.」

Walt Kowalski:「Excuse me. Walt gets up and steps into the kitchen. He takes several deep breaths. He's pretty shook up.
 Je -- zuz -- Christ. Walt looks around at all the Hmongs eating and carrying on. Walt sees a young man give up his seat to an Elder. Walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks and offer tea and cookies from a tray. Walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom. Walt coughs hard. He wipes blood from his lips. Sue comes in and looks at Walt.」

narrator:EPIPHANY. Walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands. He's still pale. He looks long and hard in the mirror. Walt is stunned, it all adds up. Walt hasn't really lived in 50 years, he hasn't relaxed or exhaled or let his guard down since he got back from Korea in 1953.

Walt Kowalski:「Me? I'm fine.」
SUE:「You were bleeding? Walt smiles disarmingly.」
Walt Kowalski:「I just bit my tongue. I'm fine. I'm great. Let's get some of that gook food, I'm starving.」

narrator:Walt sits amongst several old Hmong Women, who take great delight in feeding him different Hmong dishes which he's obviously never tasted before. Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food, occasionally making jokes like he's choking, etc. This corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong ladies. Sue comes in and rolls her eyes at Walt.
SUE:「Come on, you glutton, let's go downstairs.」
Walt Kowalski:「Why?」
SUE:「To mingle.」
Walt Kowalski:「I'm fine right here. I'm mingling.」

Walt Kowalski:「Oh great.」
SUE:「Well, look who's over there.」
Walt Kowalski:「What's-his-name who tried to steal my Gran Torino.」
SUE:「My brother Tao.」

Walt Kowalski:「Yeah, Toad. Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze. Sue walks over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone. Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He leans against the DRYER. The DRYER wobbles. Walt gets on his hands and knees. He looks under the dryer. He adjusts the short leg to balance out the machine. He just can't help it. All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a dryer during a party. Walt looks up -- deer in the headlights.
 It was wobbly, but I fixed it. It's fine now, shouldn't wobble anymore. The Hmong kids look away, covering their mouths with their hands. Walt glares at Tao, who immediately wipes the smile from his face. Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink.
 What's this?」

SUE:「Rice liquor. Try it.」

Walt Kowalski:「Alright. Sue walks off. Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the interaction between the boys and girls. One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL stares across the room at Tao. Tao looks back at her, but then looks away. The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her hair. Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do. They do their best to charm her. She's polite, but not interested, she keeps looking at Tao. Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this wasted opportunity. Suddenly the Girl steps over to Walt. She smiles --」
WA XAM:「GIRL) My friends and I were just wondering what you're doing here?」
Walt Kowalski:「Good question. What am I doing here? Anyways, I'm Walt.」
WA XAM:「Hi, Walt. I'm Wa Xam.」

WA XAM:「No, Wa Xam. So... what do you do?」

WA XAM:「Well, have fun. I'm going to take off.」
Walt Kowalski:「A pleasure to meet you, Yum Yum. She laughs at Walt butchering her name and goes upstairs. The three young suitors follow her up. Tao watches her. Walt comes over to Tao, who is startled. Walt laughs.
 Relax, zipper head, whatta you think I'm gonna do, shoot you? Tao looks like he wants to run away.
 I wouldn't say anything either, if I was you. Walt sips his rice liquor. Walt can't help but rib Tao.
 You know, I knew you were a dipshit even before the whole garage deal, but I have to say you're even worse with women than you are stealing cars, Toad.」

I had to work at it, but I got her and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. Hands down. Walt points across the room. He sways slightly.
 But you? You just sit there and watch as Ding Dong and Click Clack and Charlie Chan walk away with what's-her-face. She likes you, you know.」
TAO:「Who?」
Walt Kowalski:「She was standing over there, orange dress, twisting her hair and smiling at you.」
TAO:「You mean Wa Xam? Walt takes a long swig off his drink and nods.」

Walt Kowalski:「Yeah, yeah. Anyways, she likes you, I know, I talked to her. Great girl, charming girl. Love her. I love Yum Yum. But you? You just watch her walk out the door with the Three Stooges. Why? Because you're a big fat pussy! Walt drains his drink.」

Walt Kowalski:「No. No thanks. No more flowers. The elderly Hmong Women nod and speak rapid sentences in Hmong to Walt. He has no idea what they are saying.
 No more. Please, keep your flowers. The Hmong women nod, smile and chatter away, ignoring Walt. They walk past him and set the BOUQUETS on his porch.」

narrator:The doorbell rings. Walt answers, a Skillsaw in one hand. Standing on his doorstep are three Hmong women.
Walt Kowalski:「What now, Gee? Gee holds up a plate covered with tinfoil.
 No. Forget it. Stop bringing me stuff. Gee scolds Walt in Hmong.
 No. I've had it. Gee opens the corner of the tinfoil. Walt looks at the food.」

Walt Kowalski:「What now? What? Vu rambles on in Hmong. Walt looks at his watch. He looks at Sue for the translation.」
SUE:「Tao is here to make amends, he's here to work for you.」
Walt Kowalski:「No he's not.」
SUE:「Mother says that Tao dishonored the family and now he has to work off his debt. He'll start tomorrow morning.」
Walt Kowalski:「No. The kid is useless, I don't even want him on my property. I thought we already went over that.」
SUE:「It's very important to my mother that you accept. It'd be an insult to refuse.」

narrator:SUE/VU Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!! Tao looks at the ground. A PAUSE. Walt sees the earnest looks on the Hmong women's faces. Their expression begs Walt. Walt gazes back at Tao. Walt looks disgusted, he exhales loudly...
Walt Kowalski:「Fine. Great. Tomorrow. Walt walks past them and into his house.
 Jesus, Joseph and Mary. These Hmong broads are like badgers.」

TAO:「Count the birds?」
Walt Kowalski:「Yeah, you can count? You slopes are supposed to be good at math, right?」

Walt Kowalski:「When you're done caulking the siding, nail that gutter back up, I can see it right out my kitchen window, it's been bugging me for three years. The neighbor says something in Hmong to Walt.
 You said it, brother.」

 ASIAN DOCTOR Mr. Kowalski?
Walt Kowalski:「That's right.」

MITCH:「Busy.」
Walt Kowalski:「Right. I s'pose.」

Walt Kowalski:「No. Nope. Another pause.
 Okay then.」
MITCH:「Okay. Yeah, so it's not a good time right now. Why don't you call me over the weekend.」
Walt Kowalski:「Sure.」

narrator:While Walt fills a bird feeder, he notices Tao next door. Tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder, trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw. Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao.
Walt Kowalski:「Hey, moron. Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.」
TAO:「What?」
Walt Kowalski:「I appreciate you're doing something on your own, but you're the only person I know dumb enough to get himself killed trimming tree branches.」
TAO:「What now?」
Walt Kowalski:「You don't stand on the top step of a ladder and if you cut through that branch you're hacking away at, you'll end up kaput. Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black POWER LINE is five feet below the branch he's almost severed.
 Go grab the extension ladder from my garage and I'll show you how to do it right, zipper head.」

Walt Kowalski:「Looks good. Good job. Tao nods.」

Walt Kowalski:「Make sure you put the ladder back when you're done raking up the leaves.」
TAO:「I know. I will. Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the cooler and watches Tao rake. A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past Tao. Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass.」
Walt Kowalski:「This kid doesn't have a chance. The Honda now slowly passes Walt's house. Walt just stands there, sipping his beer. The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at Walt. The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens. Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN. He closes one eye to better aim his imaginary gun and moves his thumb several times as if firing. Bang -- bang -- bang. The Honda takes off. Walt watches it drive off and lights another cigarette. Walt doesn't notice, but Tao witnessed this whole interaction from his yard.」

narrator:Tao looks on as Walt turns the faucet on and off, it drips water at its base. Walt looks under the sink.
Walt Kowalski:「For the love of Pete.」
TAO:「What?」
Walt Kowalski:「It must be a hundred degrees in here, turn on the fan. Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off. Walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head.」

narrator:

TAO:「Man, where did you get all this stuff?」
Walt Kowalski:「What are you talking about?」
TAO:「All the tools and stuff.」
Walt Kowalski:「Where the hell do you think I got them, Toad? This may come as a shock to a thief, but I actually bought the things I have with money I earned.」
TAO:「Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what I meant. There's just so much shit packed in here.」
Walt Kowalski:「You need the right tool for the right job. Every single thing here has a purpose.」

TAO:「Okay, what's this? Tao points to a tool.」

Walt Kowalski:「Post hole digger. Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick succession, questioning Walt with his expression.
 Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife. Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile spacers. Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but he's too uncomfortable to speak up --
 What?」
TAO:「I can't afford to buy all this stuff.」
Walt Kowalski:「I didn't buy all this stuff at once, blockhead. I've lived here for fifty years. A man stays in one place long enough he tends to attract a decent set of tools.」
TAO:「Yeah, but...」
Walt Kowalski:「Look, kid, I think I know where you're going with this. You don't need everything to maintain a house. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE items in quick succession.
 This is for you. Roll of duct tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of vise-grips. Any man who's worth a shit can do half his household jobs with these three things. In the odd chance that doesn't work out, you can borrow something.」

Walt Kowalski:「What's with what?」
TAO:「The blood you just coughed up. That's not good, you should see a doctor. Walt quickly changes the subject -- while tightening the screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub.」
Walt Kowalski:「So... what exactly was the deal with those guys out on my lawn that night? Who are they?」
TAO:「A gang. Hmong gangbangers.」
Walt Kowalski:「I gathered that. What did they want with you?」
TAO:「They wanted to take me away because I blew my first initiation.」
Walt Kowalski:「You joined up with those pukes? Damn, you are a pussy. Why in the hell did you do that?」
TAO:「I don't know. They were persuasive. My cousin's in the gang. They just talked me into it I guess.」

MITCH:「Does it work? We were thinking about getting a freezer. What are you going to do with it?」
Walt Kowalski:「Giving it to Aunt Mary.」
MITCH:「Oh... Can't she give you a hand?」
Walt Kowalski:「She's eighty-one.」
MITCH:「I know, I was joking... What does she need it for?」
Walt Kowalski:「To freeze food. Mitch opens another beer.」

MITCH:「Yeah, well, I'd love to help you out, Dad, but I'm just walking out the door. I have to bring the kids to the mall. Sorry.」
Walt Kowalski:「Uh-huh.」
MITCH:「Why don't you call Stevie?」
Walt Kowalski:「Your brother lives out of state.」
MITCH:「Well, I don't know what to tell you, I'm on my way out. Keys in my hand.」
Walt Kowalski:「Okay then.」

narrator:The doorbell rings and Tao opens the door. There stands Walt. Tao is a little shocked.
Walt Kowalski:「You got a minute, Toad?」

narrator:Walt and Tao look at the freezer strapped to the dolly.
Walt Kowalski:「I just need a little push. All the weight is up top, so you stay down and give me a little shove at each step.」
TAO:「Let me take the top.」
Walt Kowalski:「Naw, I got it.」
TAO:「No really, I'll take the top. It looks pretty heavy.」
Walt Kowalski:「I'm not crippled. I got it.」
TAO:「If you don't let me take the top, I ain't helping. I'll go home.」
Walt Kowalski:「Listen, zipper head, now's not the time to go and...」
TAO:「You listen, old man. You came and got me because you needed help, so let me help you. Either it's top or I'm out of here. Walt studies Tao for a second. Tao doesn't blink, he holds his ground. Walt nods, trying not to grin.」

Walt Kowalski:「Okay then, be my guest. Just don't let it slip out of your little girl hands and crush me. Tao laughs.」

narrator:Tao and Walt ease the freezer down the back steps and pause to take a break. They both breathe hard.
TAO:「That thing weighs a ton.」
Walt Kowalski:「Yeah, but it runs like new. They don't make them like that anymore.」
TAO:「What are you going to do with it?」
Walt Kowalski:「Sell it. I haven't used it in years and it was always in the way down there.」
TAO:「How much?」
Walt Kowalski:「Oh, I don't know. Sixty bucks, maybe. Why, you need a freezer?」
narrator:TAO
 NODS) Our downstairs one died. Walt thinks for a second.
Walt Kowalski:「Twenty-five and it's yours.」
TAO:「Twenty-five? You just said sixty?」
Walt Kowalski:「Save me from wasting money on putting an ad in the paper.」

narrator:
75:「Walt and Sue sit eating Laab as they watch Tao, who washes and waxes the Gran Torino in Walt's driveway. Sue laughs and shakes her head.」
SUE:「Kind of ironic, huh?」
Walt Kowalski:「What?」
SUE:「What the hell do you think I'm referring to? Toad washing the car he tried to steal from you.」
Walt Kowalski:「It seems like justice to me. And if he misses a spot, he's doing it all over.」
SUE:「It's nice of you to kind of look after him like this. He doesn't have any real role models in his life.」
Walt Kowalski:「I ain't a role model.」
SUE:「You're a good man, Wally. I wish our dad would have been more like you.」
Walt Kowalski:「Don't call me Wally.」
SUE:「No, I'm serious. He was hard on us, really traditional, really old school.」
Walt Kowalski:「I'm old school.」
SUE:「Yeah, but you're American.」

Walt Kowalski:「What's that supposed to mean? Sue shrugs him off. They look at Tao for awhile.」

SUE:「You like him, don't you?」
Walt Kowalski:「Him? Don't be crazy. He tried to steal my car.」
SUE:「And you spend time with him and you teach him how to fix things and you saved him from that fuck cousin of ours and...」
Walt Kowalski:「Hey. Watch the language.」
SUE:「And you're a good man.」
Walt Kowalski:「Hand me a beer, Dragon Lady. Sue hands him a beer and Walt pops the top.
 So tell me the problem with Hmong boys again. I'm not completely clear.」
SUE:「Hmong girls slip in and out of the culture more easily. Date who we want, stay close to our mothers, but are able to keep a foot on each side of the fence. The boys fall through the cracks.」
Walt Kowalski:「Why?」
SUE:「It's tough. The boys float around. The fathers belong in a totally different world and the boys have no one to turn to. Does that make sense?」

Walt Kowalski:「Not sure. No.」
SUE:「The boys don't ask their fathers for advice, because over here, their fathers no longer have the answers.」

Walt Kowalski:「The girls go to college and the boys go to jail.」
SUE:「It's more common than not. Walt reflects on this for awhile, then changes the subject.」
Walt Kowalski:「You still going out with that clown?」
SUE:「No. I dumped him. He was a dim- wit. Walt nods.」
Walt Kowalski:「Good girl.」

narrator:
76:「Walt and Tao spread mulch around Walt's vegetable plants.」
TAO:「You know, the Hmong consider gardening to be women's work.」
Walt Kowalski:「Is that why I see you out in your garden all the time? Besides, zipper head, we ain't in Hu-Mong.」

 You should quit those. It's bad for you.」

Walt Kowalski:「You've never thought about it?」
TAO:「Of course I have.」
Walt Kowalski:「Well, while you're thinking about it, try not to stomp all over my chives, you dipshit. Tao looks down; sure enough, he's standing on Walt's chives.」
TAO:「Sorry.」

Walt Kowalski:「Put some mulch around the cucumbers. Tao spreads more mulch.」
TAO:「I was thinking about sales, maybe.」
Walt Kowalski:「My oldest son's a salesman. He sells cars.」

TAO:「Does your son come over much?」
Walt Kowalski:「How are you going about getting into sales? You thinking about school?」
TAO:「Kinda.」
Walt Kowalski:「Well, you should.」
TAO:「School costs money.」
Walt Kowalski:「Maybe you should get a job and save instead of spreading mulch in my garden.」

TAO:「Maybe you could just pay me.」
Walt Kowalski:「That's funny.」
TAO:「What kind of job could I get?」

TAO:「Like what?」
Walt Kowalski:「I'd think about construction.」
TAO:「Me? Construction? What, do you have Alzheimer's or something?」
Walt Kowalski:「Naw, you could hack it. You just need a little adjustment.」
TAO:「You said yourself I'm worthless and I have soft little girl hands.」
Walt Kowalski:「That's exactly the point. I know some guys in the trades, but you have to get your shit together. We have to man you up a bit.」
TAO:「Man me up?」
Walt Kowalski:「Yes. And you should ask out Yum Yum too.」

Walt Kowalski:「You have to learn how guys talk. Now watch how me and Martin communicate. We just throw it back and forth. You ready?」

BARBER:「Who's the Nip?」
Walt Kowalski:「This is Tao. He's a pussy kid who lives next door and I'm trying to man him up a little. Walt points at Tao.
 Did you see? That's how men talk to each other.」

TAO:「They do?」
BARBER:「What, do you have shit in your ears?」
Walt Kowalski:「Okay. You go out, come back in and give it a try.」

Walt Kowalski:「Jesus Christ, Toad, you don't walk in and insult a guy. What are you, an idiot?」
TAO:「But... but that's what you said. That's what you said men say.」

Walt Kowalski:「Not if you never met the guy. If you say that shit to the wrong stranger, they'll blow your goddamned gook head off! Walt and the Barber laugh again.」
TAO:「What should I have said?」
Walt Kowalski:「Anything but that.」
BARBER:「Kid, you shoulda just started with Hi' or Hello.'」
Walt Kowalski:「Right. You should have said, Excuse me, I'm looking for a haircut if you have time.'」

BARBER:「Or, my old lady bitches to me for two fucking hours about how they don't take expired coupons at the grocery store and the minute I turn on the goddamned game, she starts crying how we never talk.」
Walt Kowalski:「See? You come back in, Toad. Be polite and then you bring up something you can both talk about. It ain't rocket science.」
TAO:「Yeah, but I don't have a job or a car or a girlfriend. Walt and the Barber laugh.」
BARBER:「Sweet Jesus, I shoulda blown his head off when I had the chance.」
Walt Kowalski:「Just go back outside and try it again. And don't mention you're a pussy with no car, girl, job, future or whatever. Come in and act like a man, Toad. Tao goes out, turns around and comes back in.」

Walt Kowalski:「You better, because when I vouch for someone, it's my word and I don't want anyone making me look bad.」
TAO:「No, I'm good. I'm totally into this.」
Walt Kowalski:「And don't lay down to people all the time. Always look a person in the eye. When you shake a man's hand, you can usually tell where you stand with him. Walt hands a pair of beat-up WORK GLOVES to Tao.

KENNEDY:「Help yourself, Walt, you dumb Pollack.」
Walt Kowalski:「I already did. This is the kid I told you about. Tao, this is Tim Kennedy, he's the super on the job. Kennedy looks Tao up and down. Tao looks him in the eye.」

TAO:「What are we doing?」
Walt Kowalski:「What are you gonna put all your tools in, an empty rice bag?」

narrator:Walt and Tao walk the aisles. Walt grabs a tool belt and tosses it to Tao.
Walt Kowalski:「You'll need this. Walt then tosses Tao a utility knife holder.
 And you'll need that. Now where the hell do they hide the hardware holders?」

TAO:「I appreciate all this.」
Walt Kowalski:「Aw, forget it.」

Walt Kowalski:「Hey there. Tao looks to the ground and heads in the other direction.」
TAO:「Hey, I gotta run.」
Walt Kowalski:「Wait a minute. Where have you been, I haven't seen you in days?」
TAO:「Busy. Walt squints at Tao. He steps closer. Tao looks away. Walt tilts Tao's head up, he sees the burn.」
Walt Kowalski:「What in the hell happened to you?」
TAO:「Don't worry about it.」
Walt Kowalski:「Don't worry about it? Look at your goddamned face!」
TAO:「I said don't worry about it. It's not your problem. Walt looks at the ground and spits.」
Walt Kowalski:「When?」

TAO:「I could use a roofing hammer.」
Walt Kowalski:「Go in the garage and get whatever you need.」

narrator:Walt sits in the dark, the only light is from the radio tuned to baseball. Daisy lies in the front seat. Next to Daisy is the M1 RIFLE. Walt watches as Spider and another Hmong gangbanger step out of the rundown duplex, get in their Honda and drive off.
Walt Kowalski:「That's the last of them. Walt pulls out his Colt .45 automatic and chambers a round.」

SMOKIE:「O.S.) What the hell did...」

SMOKIE:「How the fuck did you get here?!」
Walt Kowalski:「You aren't that hard to track down. Walt boots him again. Smokie curls up in the fetal position.」
SMOKIE:「What do you want? Walt kicks him a second time.」

Walt Kowalski:「I came to give you a chance. SOMETHING comes out of the shadows under the porch. Walt swings the barrel of the big Colt .45 at the movement. It's a cat. Walt puts his pistol away. Smokie exhales.
 It's just you and me. Nobody knows or has to know I was here. You lay off Tao. Tell your guys he ain't worth it or whatever the hell you want. You don't talk to him, you don't go near him. This is your one chance. You lay off and no one will ever be the wiser. Smokie says nothing.
 I'll take that as a yes. I don't want to come back here. But if I do, believe me, it'll be goddamned ugly. Walt kicks Smokie again and stalks off into the dark.」

Walt Kowalski:「Is this Hmoog or Laab?」
SUE:「Laab.」
Walt Kowalski:「Isn't it usually a little spicier? Tao, Wa Xam and Sue laugh.」

Walt Kowalski:「Is everyone okay? Is anyone hit? Sue? Vu? Tao, where's Tao? Tao sits up from behind the couch. Blood pours down his neck. He's stunned.

TAO:「It's a miracle no one was killed.」
Walt Kowalski:「They aimed high. Sure enough -- most of the bullet holes are above head level on the walls.
 Where's Sue?」
TAO:「She went to our aunt's.」
Walt Kowalski:「Call her.」
TAO:「What?」

Walt Kowalski:「I said call her. Get the goddamned phone and call and see if she's there. Tao scrambles for the phone and dials. Tao speaks Hmong to whomever answered. Tao starts to speak faster. He looks at Walt and shakes his head no. For once -- Vu and Phong understand what Walt was talking about. There is anguish on every face in the room.」

narrator:Walt sits across from Tao, drinking rice liquor. Walt speaks loudly, without any consideration for Phong who shoots him dirty looks.
Walt Kowalski:「This is exactly what I didn't want. Damn gooks. Why the hell am I even here?」
TAO:「Maybe one of her friends called and she just changed plans. Walt sips the rice liquor. Walt now speaks quietly to Tao.」
Walt Kowalski:「In Korea I learned not to care. The best friends of my life are still missing somewhere in Korea. You harden yourself. Don't let anything get to you. Phong looks out the window and screams. She runs over and swings open the door. Everyone expects the worst... And it comes like a cold wind -- SUE WALKS IN LIKE A ZOMBIE. She has been brutally beaten. Her clothes are dirty and torn. BLOOD runs down SUE'S legs from under her shirt. Walt looks at her and the glass falls from his hand. Sue staggers into Vu's arms. Vu weeps. Sue hugs her mother and sobs. Tao reaches to hug his sister, but Phong screeches at him, pointing at Walt and back to Tao. Walt is destroyed. He steps outside into the dark.」

FATHER JANOVICH:「Mr. Kowalski, are you in here?」
Walt Kowalski:「Come on in. Father Janovich comes in and sits down across from Walt.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Are you okay? Walt nods.
 The police finally left. No one is talking. One thing about the Hmong, they keep their mouths shut.」
Walt Kowalski:「I've noticed that. Father Janovich picks up a photo album and flips through it. Pictures of Mitch and Steve as babies.
 You know, there's no way that Tao or Sue are gonna have any peace if these gang guys don't go away. Go away forever. You know it as well as I do.」

Walt Kowalski:「Yeah, well what would you do if you were me? If you were Tao? What would you do? Father Janovich shakes his head.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「I know what I'd do if I was you, or at least what you think you should do. If I was Tao I guess I'd want vengeance. I'd want to stand shoulder to shoulder with you and kill those guys.」
Walt Kowalski:「And you?」
FATHER JANOVICH:「What would I do? I'd come over here and talk to you I guess. I know you're close with these people, but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski. Walt nods.」

Walt Kowalski:「Sit down.」

 I know what needs to be done. I need to prepare, this needs to be carefully planned. You know I'm the right man for this. So cool down for a little while and meet me back here at 4 P.M. I promise you, what needs to be done, will be done.」
TAO:「I say we go now. Right now.」
Walt Kowalski:「And do what? You want to go kill your cousin and those other Zips. Mr. Tough-Guy-All-Of-A-Sudden is out for blood. What do you even know about it? Tao is furious, but says nothing.

 I'm going over to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.」
Walt Kowalski:「Is that so?」
FATHER JANOVICH:「It is. And every other day until you see the folly in what you are planning.」
Walt Kowalski:「I gotta go, Padre. Busy day ahead.」
FATHER JANOVICH:「Go in peace.」
Walt Kowalski:「I am at peace. Walt and Father Janovich shake hands. Walt exits. Father Janovich exhales loudly and drops into his chair.」

narrator:
101:「Walt carefully reassembles the two weapons he just cleaned and oiled. Tao comes in and looks down at the two weapons -- The 30-06 M1 GARAND RIFLE and the COLT .45 PISTOL. Tao picks up the heavy RIFLE.」
TAO:「Which one do I get?」
Walt Kowalski:「You ever fire a weapon?」
narrator:CONTINUED:

 PAGE 108
TAO:「No. Tao aims the rifle at an imaginary target.」
Walt Kowalski:「Put that down. I got something for you.」
TAO:「What?」
Walt Kowalski:「In Korea, October, 1952. We were sent up to sweep a Chink machine gun nest that had carved us up pretty bad. I was the only one who came back... I received the Silver Star. I want you to have it.」
TAO:「Why?」
Walt Kowalski:「When we went up that hill, we knew it was ten to one against us, but we went anyway. This trouble now, it's similar. We're walking right into it. We might not be coming home tonight.」

TAO:「The hell we won't. We're going to roll in there and tear ass.」
Walt Kowalski:「Don't be a fool, these guys are waiting for that exact reaction. Tao is quiet for a minute.」
TAO:「How many?」
Walt Kowalski:「How many what?」
TAO:「How many men did you kill in Korea?」
Walt Kowalski:「Thirteen for sure. Probably more.」
narrator:CONTINUED:

TAO:「What was it like to kill a man?」
Walt Kowalski:「You don't want to know.」
TAO:「Why not?」
Walt Kowalski:「Go get the Silver Star. It's in a blue wooden box in the cellar. Tao goes downstairs. He turns on the light and goes into the cellar. Tao locates a BLUE WOODEN BOX and opens it. Tao holds up the MEDAL. He looks at it closely. AND WHAM -- Walt slams the heavy cellar DOOR shut behind him. Walt slides the BOLT LOCK into place with a loud」
narrator:CLICK. Tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years. Of course he tries anyway. Tao is furious. He throws things.

TAO:「What the hell are you doing?! Let me out of here, you goddamned son- of-a-bitch!!」
Walt Kowalski:「Quit smashing everything. You'll never get out of there, so just relax.」
TAO:「You let me out, you crazy old fuck, or I will kill you when I get out of here. Tao pounds on the door. Walt pounds back with a strength and authority which startles Tao.」
Walt Kowalski:「You want to know how it feels to kill a man? It feels goddamned lousy. And it feels even worse when you get a medal for bravery right after you mowed down some scared kid when he tries to give up. A dumb, scared, little gook, just about your age. I shot him with the same rifle you just held upstairs.」
narrator:CONTINUED: (2)

 PAGE 110 I've thought about that kid for fifty years. And I promise you, boy, you want no part of it. Me, I've got blood on my hands. I'm soiled. Forgive me for tricking you like a dope. I'll call someone and have them let you out later.
TAO:「No! Let me out!! Tao pounds on the door.」

Walt Kowalski:「You've come a long way. I'm proud to call you a friend. You have your whole life ahead of you, whereas this is what I do. I finish things. You'd just get in the way. Sorry. Walt goes back upstairs, leaving Tao locked up in his cellar. Tao howls to be let out.」

narrator:Walt walks out his front door with Daisy on her leash. He walks over to Tao's house. Phong sits in a lawnchair and glares at Walt. She yells in Hmong as Walt walks straight up to her.
Walt Kowalski:「Aw, pipe down, you hag.」
narrator:PHONG
 SUBTITLED) You're an evil man. I've seen your kind before. Back home, white soldiers came to our villages and filled our young men's minds with ideas of glory. Then you'd lead them away to their deaths. Walt, of course, has no idea what she said.
Walt Kowalski:「Fine, I hate you too.」
narrator:CONTINUED: (3)
Walt Kowalski:「」
narrator:CONTINUED)
 PAGE 111 Walt holds out the DOG LEASH to Phong. She looks down at Daisy and back at Walt. She lashes out again in Hmong.

Walt Kowalski:「I need you to watch my dog. Walt holds the leash closer. Phong folds her arms in defiance. Walt exhales loudly. Walt lifts up one of the LEGS OF HER LAWNCHAIR and slips the loop of the leash underneath it so Daisy can't follow him.
 Her name is Daisy. Walt bends down on one knee and lovingly pets Daisy. He scratches her belly.
 You take it easy, old gal. You good old girl. Walt gets up and walks away without looking back. Phong is stunned; she is silent for once.」

narrator:Walt walks in and sits down. He nods to the regulars.
Walt Kowalski:「Good afternoon, gentlemen.」
narrator:DARREL Walter, how are you doing?
 WALTER Never been better.
 BARTENDER Beer and a shot, Walt?
Walt Kowalski:「I think I'll have something different. Walt looks at the liquor display. At the pinnacle of bottles sits a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.
 Think I'll try that Johnnie Walker Blue Label.」
narrator:CONTINUED:

 PAGE 112 The regulars all Oooooo and Ahhhhhhh at Walt's order.
 MEL Whatta ya win the lottery, Wally?
Walt Kowalski:「Naw, just having something special. Walt sips his Scotch and nods. It's good.
 Why don't you get all the guys the same.」
narrator:BARTENDER You sure?
Walt Kowalski:「I'm sure. This is too good not to be shared. Walt finishes his Scotch and points for one more. Several regulars hold up their drinks towards Walt.」

narrator:Sue weakly answers the phone next to her bed.
SUE:「Hello?」
Walt Kowalski:「V.O.) It's Walt. The key to my front door is under the ceramic turtle. Open the door and go let your brother out of the cellar. I have to go. The line goes dead as Walt hangs up. Sue jumps up out of bed, pulls on some clothes and runs downstairs. Phong blocks her path. Phong grabs Sue by the arms.」

narrator:
106:「Father Janovich paces back and forth. The SQUAD CAR pulls up to him, which is exactly what he's been afraid of all day.」
narrator:OFFICER Sorry, Father, we have to go.
FATHER JANOVICH:「I'm telling you. If we're not here, there will be bloodshed.」
narrator:OFFICER We've been here for hours. We can't afford to anchor a unit to one location.
FATHER JANOVICH:「I'm begging you to stay.」
narrator:OFFICER I just got word from my Sergeant, we're pulling the plug.
FATHER JANOVICH:「I'm staying.」
narrator:OFFICER No you aren't. My orders are specific. You came with us, you're leaving with us. Father Janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting into the SQUAD CAR. The SQUAD CAR drives off. Walt pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams the door. He looks at the duplex. It's a total eyesore.
 WALT
 MUTTERS) What a goddamned mess. You slopes should be ashamed of yourselves.

 PAGE 114 Walt walks up the sidewalk and stops twenty feet from the duplex. Six very scared, very jittery Hmong gangbangers look out at Walt from various doorways and windows.
Walt Kowalski:「Is that all you swamp rats or is there more vermin scurrying in the shadows? Smokie and Spider step out and stand on the porch. Smokie smiles at Walt. Walt spits on the ground.」

SMOKIE:「I wasn't sure that you'd...」
Walt Kowalski:「Shut up, gook. I'm not here to listen to one goddamned syllable of what a shrimp-dicked little baby midget like you has to say. Spider pulls his PISTOL.
 That's right, boy. Defend your boyfriend after he or you or whoever rapes a member of your family. Your own blood, for Christ's sake. Go ahead, pull your pistols, just like a bunch of ridiculous miniature toy cowboys. Smokie and several other Hmong gangbangers pull their guns.
 You have no honor. You're the scum of the earth and when you're gone, do you think anyone will care? No one will mourn. You won't be missed. All the Hmong are spooked at Walt's absolute lack of fear.」
SMOKIE:「Where's Tao, old man? He too scared to come and stick up for himself?」
narrator:CONTINUED:

 PAGE 115
Walt Kowalski:「No. Tao is too good for this. You pukes aren't worth one second of his time. Walt slowly puts a CIGARETTE in his mouth. Even this slight movement has the gangbangers waving their PISTOLS around. Walt laughs.
 You boys are a little bit jumpy.」

SPIDER:「You watch it, old man.」
Walt Kowalski:「No, I think you'd better watch it. Walt looks around. Other than the gangbangers, a small group of people have gathered to watch this showdown.」

narrator:WALT AND COMPANY...
Walt Kowalski:「Anybody got a light? No? I got one. Walt's slight grin fades. He mutters to himself...
 Hail Mary, full of grace. Walt reaches into his coat pocket. Six Hmong gangbangers simultaneously level their PISTOLS and FIRE. BULLETS FLY. Walt is struck down. People scream. Walt falls dead. A ZIPPO lighter clutched in his hand. Walt never intended to kill anyone. Self-sacrifice.」
