narrator:He EMERGES, now sprouting HYDROFOIL and speeds away.
GREM:「NONPLUSSED) Get to the boats.」
narrator:THE BOATS - an army of combat ships quickly DROP into the sea and CHURN WATER with unprecedented fury as they quickly make up the distance between them and Finn, FIRING BULLETS as they do so.
ACER:「He's getting away!」
narrator:COMBAT SHIP Not for long.
 The LEAD COMBAT SHIP quietly drops a TORPEDO into the water. It skips along, connecting with Finn in his rear and EXPLODING with such force that water skyrockets into the night clouds.
 UNDERWATER - McMissile SINKS. Then, he blinks. He GRINS. We're starting to like this grin and what follows it. He now CONVERTS into a submarine. From his trunk he releases four DECOY tires which float to the surface like body parts.
 ON THE DERRICK - Professor Zundapp watches it all from far away.
GREM:「OVER RADIO) He's dead, Professor.」
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP:「Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile gone, who can stop us now?」
narrator:EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
 TOW MATER, a rusty tow truck, putters into view.
Mater:「Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is here to help you!」

narrator:He approaches a broken-down sedan on the side of the road. He drives around to the front, catching OTIS' face for the first time.
Mater:「Hey, Otis! 7.」

OTIS:「Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I thought I could make it this time, but... (he tries to start his engine, stalls) Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who am I kidding? I'll always be a lemon.」
narrator:Mater hooks his friend and starts towing him.
Mater:「Well dadgum, you're leaking oil again. Must be your gaskets. Hey, look on the bright side: This is your tenth tow this month, so that means it's on the house.」
OTIS:「You're the only one that's nice to lemons like me, Mater.」
Mater:「Don't sweat it. These things happen to everybody, Otis.」
OTIS:「But you never leak oil.」
Mater:「Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust is starting to show through.」
narrator:Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN. It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen."
OTIS:「Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?」
Mater:「Not yet.」

Mater:「Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him. But I sure wish he'd hurry up and get back `cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for. Just me and --」
narrator:Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible.
Mater:「McQueen!」
narrator:Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him.
OTIS:「Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You don't need to go so fast!」
narrator:Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air.
 EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
 Lightning McQueen is surrounded by his hometown friends.
LUIGI:「Oh, Lightning. Welcome home.」
FLO:「Good to have you back, honey.」
FILLMORE:「Congratulations, man.」
SARGE:「Welcome home, soldier.」
narrator:SHERIFF The place wasn't the same without you, son.
 LIZZIE What? Did he go somewhere?
MCQUEEN:「It's good to be home, everybody.」
Mater:「O.S.) McQueen!」

Mater:「McQueen!」
narrator:Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion, slingshots Otis forward ---
OTIS:「Woaahhhhh!」
narrator:right through Ramone's front door ---
 INT. RAMONE'S - CONTINUOUS
 where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift. Ramone lifts him up, routine.
 RAMONE Hey. How far'd you make it this time, Otis?
OTIS:「Halfway to the county line.」
narrator:RAMONE Not bad, man.
OTIS:「I know, I can't believe it either!」
narrator:EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - CONTINUOUS
Mater:「McQueen, welcome back!」
MCQUEEN:「Mater, it's so good to see you.」
Mater:「You too, buddy.」
narrator:Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump style).
Mater:「Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe the things I got planned for us.」

Mater:「TO MCQUEEN) You ready to have some serious fun?」
MCQUEEN:「Well, actually I've got something to show you first.」
narrator:INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY
 CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned with a small likeness of Doc. It says "Hudson Hornet Piston Cup."
Mater:「Wow. I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson.」
narrator:McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public. McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera.
MCQUEEN:「I know Doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know?」
Mater:「Well, Doc would've been real proud of you. That's for sure.」
narrator:McQueen takes this in.
 EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER
 McQueen and Mater exit the Doc Hudson Museum.
MCQUEEN:「Alright, pal. I've been waiting all summer for this. What've you got planned?」
Mater:「You sure you can handle it?」

narrator:EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
 Mater and McQueen roll on an old train track, their tires off. They're on their rims.
MCQUEEN:「Uh.... Mater?!」
Mater:「Just remember, your brakes ain't gonna work on these!」
narrator:As they head INTO A DARK TUNNEL ---
MCQUEEN:「O.S.) Mater!」
Mater:「O.S.) Relax, these train tracks ain't been used in years!」
narrator:From inside the tunnel a loud TRAIN HORN. The two friends emerge, going as fast as they can on train tracks, uphill, with no tires.
MCQUEEN:「Come on, come on! Faster, faster!」
narrator:Moments later a harmless GALLOPING GOOSE appears, oversized horn visible, cackling and laughing at his prank.
 EXT. FIELD - OUTSIDE RADIATOR SPRINGS - LATER
 An ENORMOUS EARTH MOVER sleeps. McQueen and Mater sneak up.
Mater:「This is gonna be good!」
narrator:They blow their horns and he TIPS OVER, tractor-tipping style. They LAUGH at the gag, but soon realize the earth mover's GIANT EXHAUST PIPE is directly above them.
Mater:「Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.」

Mater:「Boy, this was the best day ever! And my favorite souvenir?」
narrator:Mater proudly shows off a dent.
Mater:「This new dent!」
MCQUEEN:「Boy, Mater. Today was, uh...」
Mater:「Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til you see what I got planned for tonight.」
MCQUEEN:「Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of thinking of just a quiet dinner.」
Mater:「That's exactly what I was thinking.」
MCQUEEN:「No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.」
Mater:「Even better! You, me and Miss Sally going out for supper.」
narrator:McQueen pulls around in front of Mater, stops.
MCQUEEN:「Mater, I meant it would be just me and Sally.」
Mater:「Oh.」
MCQUEEN:「It's just for tonight. We'll do whatever you want tomorrow.」
Mater:「DISAPPOINTED) Okay.」
MCQUEEN:「Thanks for understanding.」
Mater:「Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have fun now. 13.」

MCQUEEN:「Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo!」
narrator:McQueen drives off. Mater watches him go.
 EXT. THE WHEEL WELL - NIGHT
 It's been converted into a white-tablecloth restaurant, with cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside.
 MCQUEEN AND SALLY have a prime table with a view of Radiator Springs and the starry night sky.
SALLY:「This is so nice.」
MCQUEEN:「I can't tell you how good it is to be here alone. Just the two of us. Finally, you and me ---」
Mater:「O.S.) Good evening.」
narrator:Mater is at their table, dressed as a waiter.
Mater:「My name is Mater and I'll be your waiter. (TO HIMSELF) Mater the waiter. That's funny right there.」
MCQUEEN:「Mater, you work here?」
Mater:「Well yeah I work here. What'd you think, I just snuck in here when nobody was looking and pretended to be your waiter, just so I could hang out with you?」
narrator:McQueen and Sally exchange a look.
MCQUEEN:「Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that be?」

Mater:「Now, can I start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks? 14.」

MCQUEEN:「Yes. I'll have my usual.」
SALLY:「You know what? I'm going to have that too.」
narrator:Mater blinks.
Mater:「Uh, right. Your usual. CUT TO:」
narrator:INSIDE AT THE BAR - Fillmore and Sarge watch as Guido mixes drinks, ala "Cocktail." Mater arrives.
Mater:「Guido! What's McQueen's usual?」
narrator:GUIDO (in Italian, subtitled) How should I know?
Mater:「Perfect! Give me two of `em.」

narrator:Images of oil derricks torn down; Miles Axlerod getting converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals.
MEL DORADO:「ON TV) Now he claims to have done it with his Allinol.」
narrator:Images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all combining to form the Allinol logo.
MEL DORADO:「ON TV) And to show the world what his new superfuel can do, he's created a racing competition like no other, inviting the greatest champions from around the globe to battle in the first ever World Grand Prix. Welcome Sir Miles Axlerod.」
narrator:SIR MILES AXLEROD arrives, parks across from Mel's desk.
MILES AXLEROD:「ON TV) Thank you, Mel. It is very good to be here. Now listen to me: Big Oil. It costs a fortune. Pollution is getting worse. I mean, come on. It's a fossil fuel. Fossil. As in dead dinosaurs. And we all know what happened to them. Alternative energy is the future. Trust me, Mel, after seeing Allinol in action at the World Grand Prix, nobody will ever go back to gasoline again.」
Mater:「TO FILLMORE) What happened to the dinosaurs, now?」

SALLY:「What? He's nice to look at. You know, open-wheeled and all.」
MCQUEEN:「What's wrong with fenders? I thought you like my fenders.」
MATER'S VOICE:「ON TV) Well let me tell you something else there, Mr. San Francisco ---」
MCQUEEN:「Mater?」
MATER'S VOICE:「ON TV) McQueen could drive circles around you.」
FRANCESCO:「ON TV) Driving in circles is all he can do, no?」
MATER'S VOICE:「ON TV) No! I mean yes. I mean he could beat you anywhere, anytime, any track.」
narrator:On McQueen - he looks at Guido who gives a nod over to ---
 Mater, turned away from the crowd, still on the phone.
FRANCESCO:「ON TV) Mel, can we move on? Francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation. Like a dump truck.」
narrator:ON MCQUEEN. He doesn't like this at all.
Mater:「Ha ha! That shows what you know. Dump trucks is dumb.」

MCQUEEN:「I know, I know. I just got back. But we won't be long and ---」
SALLY:「Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've got enough to do here. Mater's going to have a blast though. (off McQueen's silence) You're bringing Mater, right? You never bring him to any of your races.」
narrator:McQueen turns to the bar where Mater privately tries their drinks, hates it, spits it back in the glass.
SALLY:「Just let him sit in the pits, give him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a thrill of a lifetime for him.」
narrator:Mater arrives.
Mater:「Your drinks, sir.」
MCQUEEN:「Mater.」
Mater:「I didn't taste it!」
MCQUEEN:「How'd you like to come and see the world with me?」
Mater:「You mean it?」

narrator:the rest of Radiator Springs watches them board a plane. Red bawls.
 IN THE JET, LATER. McQueen and Mater are the only ones awake, watch an insane Japanese game show.
 JAPAN AT NIGHT. A stylish Tokyo cityscape of neon, glamour, scrolling billboards, vending machines and high-tech skyscrapers.
 INSIDE A SOUVENIR SHOP loaded with McQueen toys: Mater and McQueen enter. A tourist sees McQueen and faints.
 A KABUKI THEATER. Team McQueen watches a methodical dance. Mater, dressed in Kabuki makeup, arrives. He looks insane.
 A SUMO MATCH - Two SUZUKI SAMURAI CARS wrestle over a parking space. Mater, now in his element, cheers.
 The MONTAGE ENDS on this high note as we CUT TO ---
 EXT. MUSEUM - TOKYO - NIGHT
 TEAM MCQUEEN, as they roll up the red carpet. Press is held at bay behind ropes. WORLD GRAND PRIX and ALLINOL logos are strategically placed for maximum press exposure. RACERS are interviewed by press behind the red-carpet ropes.
 INT. TOKYO MUSEUM - NIGHT
 Team McQueen enters via a second floor landing which overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum. As they roll down a ramp to the party, they are awed.
LUIGI:「Guido, look! Ferraris and tires! Let's go!」
MCQUEEN:「IMPRESSED) Hey, look at this. Okay now Mater, remember: best behavior.」
Mater:「You got it, buddy. Hey, what's that?」

narrator:It's fellow racers JEFF GORVETTE and LEWIS HAMILTON. McQueen now has no choice but to let Mater go.
MCQUEEN:「Hey, Jeff. Lewis! CUT TO:」
narrator:MATER as he approaches a GLASS-ENCLOSED ROCK GARDEN where a pitty RAKES rocks with precision. He knocks on the glass with his hook.
Mater:「Hey! You done good! You got all the leaves!」
narrator:People turn at the noise he's making. CUT BACK TO:
 MCQUEEN, JEFF and LEWIS.
 JEFF GORVETTE Check out that tow truck.
 LEWIS HAMILTON I wonder who that guy's with?
MCQUEEN:「Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?」
narrator:He zips over to Mater's side, quickly pulls him out of sight.
MCQUEEN:「Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator Springs.」
Mater:「You're just realizing that? Boy, that jet-lag really done a number on you.」
MCQUEEN:「Mater, look -- things are different over here. Which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different too.」
Mater:「Different than what?」

Mater:「You need help? Shoot, why didn't you just say so? That's what a tow truck does. Hey, looky there, it's Mr. San Francisco!」
narrator:FRANCESCO is visible across the room, holding court.
Mater:「I'll introduce you.」
MCQUEEN:「Mater, no.」
Mater:「already on his way) Look at me -- I'm helping you already!」
narrator:On FRANCESCO - MOMENTS LATER. Mater approaches, giddy.
Mater:「Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you to meet ---」
FRANCESCO:「Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.」
MCQUEEN:「Nice to meet you, Francesco.」
FRANCESCO:「Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are very good-looking. Not as good as I thought, but you're good.」
Mater:「TO FRANCESCO) Excuse me. Can I get a picture with you?」
FRANCESCO:「Anything for McQueen's friend.」
narrator:As Mater poses for a photo with Francesco:
Mater:「Miss Sally is gonna flip when she sees this. She's Lightning McQueen's girlfriend.」

Mater:「She's a big fan of yours.」
FRANCESCO:「Hey, she has good taste.」
MCQUEEN:「Mater's prone to exaggeration. I wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.」
Mater:「You're right. She's a huge fan. She goes on and on about your open wheels here.」
MCQUEEN:「Mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going "on and on."」
FRANCESCO:「Francesco is familiar with this reaction to Francesco. Women respect a car that has nothing to hide.」
MCQUEEN:「Yeah, uh...」
FRANCESCO:「Let us have a toast.」
narrator:McQueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.
MCQUEEN:「Let's.」
FRANCESCO:「raising a drink) I dedicate my win tomorrow... to Miss Sally.」
MCQUEEN:「Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY win tomorrow to her. So if we both do it, it's really not so special. Besides, I don't have a drink.」
Mater:「I'll go get you one. You mind if I borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks? 25.」

MCQUEEN:「could kill him) They're free, Mater.」
Mater:「Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing here?」

FINN:「Those thugs down there were on the oil platform. If they see me, the whole mission is compromised.」
HOLLEY:「No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm in Diagnostics. I'm not a field agent.」
FINN:「You are now. CUT TO:」
narrator:MATER as he grabs a drink, keeps moving.
Mater:「I'll take one of them.」
narrator:He snatches it, drops it in the back where we now see a large assortment of drinks balanced.
Mater:「Never know which one McQueen'll have a hankering for.」
narrator:He approaches a sushi bar.
Mater:「Hey, what you got here that's free? How about that pistachio ice cream?」
narrator:He refers to wasabi, of course.
 SUSHI CHEF No, no. Wasabi.
Mater:「Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up with you? That looks delicious.」
narrator:The chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for Mater.
Mater:「Uh, a little more, please. It is free, right? (the chef adds more) Keep it coming. A little more. Come on, let's go, it's free! You're getting there... Scoop scoop!」

Mater:「There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of ice cream.」
narrator:SUSHI CHEF (in Japanese, subtitles) My condolences. CUT BACK TO:
 MILES AXLEROD - He's now nearly done with his intros.
MILES AXLEROD:「and now, our last competitor --- Number 95, Lightning McQueen!」
narrator:MCQUEEN approaches the microphone, flashes his headlights.
MCQUEEN:「Thank you so much for having us, Sir Axlerod. I really look forward to racing. This is a great opportunity.」
MILES AXLEROD:「Oh, the pleasure is all ours, Lightning. You and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition.」
narrator:As if on cue, Mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain. Everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage, making a bee-line for that FOUNTAIN.
Mater:「Somebody get me water!」
narrator:He laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat.
Mater:「LAPPING WATER) Sweet relief...」
narrator:Miles Axlerod is shocked. The crowd can't believe it. Francesco cackles. Mater, now sated, approaches the mic.
Mater:「to the crowd) Whatever you do, do not eat the free pistachio ice cream. It has turned!」

MILES AXLEROD:「I know him. This is the bloke that called into the television show. (TO MATER) You're the one I have to thank.」
Mater:「No, thank you. This trip's been amazing.」
MILES AXLEROD:「TO MCQUEEN) He's a little excited, isn't he?」
narrator:TILT DOWN to reveal a pool of oil beneath Mater.
MCQUEEN:「Mater!」
Mater:「But wait, I... oh, shoot.」
narrator:McQueen quickly pulls Mater aside, out of earshot of Miles Axlerod and the others. McQueen is beside himself.
MCQUEEN:「Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene.」
Mater:「But I never leak oil. Never.」
MCQUEEN:「Go take care of yourself right now.」
narrator:Mater drives off.
 ON MATER - MOMENTS LATER
 He drives through the party, frantic.
Mater:「Coming through! Excuse me, leakin' oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank you. I gotta go!」

Mater:「CONFUSED) What the...」
narrator:Mater chooses one, drives inside. A SHRIEK is heard and Mater zips out.
Mater:「Sorry ladies!」
narrator:He heads into the other door --- CUT TO:
 INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
 Mater rolls in, still `holding it in' like a kid.
Mater:「I never leak I never leak I never leak...」
narrator:He sees someone leaving a stall. He heads in.
 IN THE STALL - Mater enters, looks up.
Mater:「Wowee...」
narrator:The stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights. High-tech Japanese. It suddenly GRABS MATER, hoists him up as if he's going to get an oil change.
Mater:「What in the---」
narrator:A Japanese style cartoon CARICATURE appears on a TV MONITOR, followed by images of waterfalls and rivers.
Mater:「GIGGLING) Hey, that tickles.」

FINN:「So go in!」
HOLLEY:「I can't just go into the men's loo.」
FINN:「Time is of the essence, Shiftwell.」
narrator:INT. BATHROOM - OUTSIDE THE STALL
 Rod Redline is in bad shape. He backs away, betrays a look of concern. He's in trouble here.
 ACER burns rubber, ready to finish him off. Just as he shifts into DRIVE ---
 MATER'S STALL DOOR KICKS OPEN, knocking ACER out. Mater jumps out, face-to-face GREM.
Mater:「out of breath) Whatever you do, I would not go in there.」
narrator:The door SWINGS shut, revealing the pulverized Acer.
Mater:「A Gremlin and a Pacer!」
narrator:Rod Redline, now behind Mater and sensing an opportunity here, quickly produces A SMALL DEVICE.
Mater:「to Grem and Acer) No offense to your makes and models, but you guys break down harder than my cousin Betsy after she got left at the ---」
narrator:Rod Redline, surreptitiously attaches the device to Mater's undercarriage.
Mater:「as he's goosed) --- altar!」
narrator:He spins around, sees Rod Redline for the first time.

Mater:「Are you okay?」

GREM:「Hey. Tow truck.」
narrator:Mater turns back to Grem and Acer.
GREM:「We'd like to get to our private business here, if you don't mind.」
Mater:「Oh, yeah. Don't let me get in the way of your "private business." Oh! A little advice: When you hear her giggle and see that waterfall, you best press that green button.」
GREM:「Thank you.」
Mater:「It's to adjust the temperature.」
ACER:「Got it.」
Mater:「Remember it's in Celsius, not Fahrenheit.」
narrator:GREM AND ACER Get outta here!
Mater:「Alright then.」
narrator:Mater exits, leaving Rod Redline to a now even angrier Grem and Acer.
 EXT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
 Holley arrives at the door. She takes a breath, is about to enter when Mater EXITS.
Mater:「Excuse me, ma'am.」
narrator:He passes her, expelling some exhaust in the process. Holley's rearview tracking confirms that the device is on him.
Mater:「TO HIMSELF) Dadgum pistachio ice cream. 35.」

HOLLEY:「INTO RADIO) This cannot be him.」
FINN:「OVER RADIO) Is he American?」
Mater:「driving off, to himself) Look out, ladies. Mater's fittin' to get funky!」
HOLLEY:「INTO RADIO) Extremely.」
FINN:「OVER RADIO) Then it's him.」
narrator:It's settled. Holley takes one more nervous breath, quickly closes the distance between her and Mater, cuts him off. He is forced to STOP.
HOLLEY:「Hello.」
Mater:「Well, hello.」
HOLLEY:「A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no radiator.」
Mater:「Well of course it doesn't. That's `cause it's air-cooled!」
HOLLEY:「RELIEVED) Perfect. I'm from the Tokyo Station OF THE---」
Mater:「Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the only ones. Besides the Beetles you had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with the pancake motors...」
HOLLEY:「Yeah. Okay, I get it---」
Mater:「And before both of them, there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy Fillmore's one of them. 36.」

HOLLEY:「Listen! We should find somewhere more private.」
Mater:「Uh, gee. Don't you think that's a little, uh ---」
HOLLEY:「NERVOUS ENERGY) You're right. Impossible to know which areas here are compromised. So, when can I see you again?」
Mater:「Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be out there at the races.」
HOLLEY:「Got it. We'll rendezvous then.」
narrator:INT. PARTY - MOMENTS LATER
 Mater returns to his team, lost in thought.
MCQUEEN:「There you are. Where have you been?」
Mater:「What's a rendezvous?」
LUIGI:「It's like a date.」
Mater:「A date?!」
MCQUEEN:「Mater, what's going on?」
Mater:「Well, what's going on is I've got me a date tomorrow.」
narrator:Guido makes a crack in Italian.
LUIGI:「Guido don't believe you.」
Mater:「Well, believe it. My new girlfriend just said so. Hey, there she is.」

Mater:「YELLING) Hey! Hey lady!」
narrator:Holley, caught in plain view, DRIVES OFF.
Mater:「See ya tomorrow!」

narrator:ON PIT ROW - We TRACK PAST as the various Crew Chiefs on their crash carts bark orders to their racers. We end on Team McQueen. No Crew Chief, just a solid looking team.
SARGE:「His suspension stats look good.」
LUIGI:「Tire pressure is excellent.」
FILLMORE:「He's got plenty of fuel.」
Mater:「And he's awesome! CUT TO:」

narrator:IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - Mater watches the monitors, sees them approaching the dirt section.
Mater:「McQueen! It's time to make your move. Get on the outside and show 'em what Doc done taught you.」

Mater:「Wow! Some of them fellers is really loud.」
HOLLEY:「OVER MATER'S RADIO) Can you hear me? Over.」
Mater:「Uh, what?」
HOLLEY:「OVER MATER'S RADIO) Get out of the pit now. Do you hear me?」
narrator:Mater realizes this girl has somehow broken into his radio.
Mater:「INTO RADIO) Hey, I know you. You're that girl from the party last night. You wanna do our date right now?」
narrator:ON THE TRACK - McQueen boxes out Francesco, holds his slim lead, but barely.
MCQUEEN:「Guys, a little too much chatter. Let's keep this line clear.」
narrator:BOOM! A racer behind McQueen suddenly expels black smoke, skids out of control.
 ON GREM - laughing. That was clearly his handiwork.
 IN MCQUEEN'S PIT - SAME
HOLLEY:「ON MATER'S RADIO) There's no time for messing about. You've got to get out of the pits.」
Mater:「Is there gonna be cable where you is so I can watch the rest of the race?」

FINN:「OVER RADIO) Get him out of there.」
HOLLEY:「TO FINN) I'm trying. (TO MATER) Get out now!」
narrator:We CUT BACK TO ---
 MATER. He gives in, exits the pit.
Mater:「Well, all right but I usually like to have a proper detailing done before I meet a lady friend.」

Mater:「Hey, new lady friend? You like flowers?」
narrator:ON THE TRACK - McQueen, hearing this, is taken aback.
MCQUEEN:「What?」
narrator:ON MATER - Slowing at the flower shop.
HOLLEY:「OVER RADIO) No! Don't go 'in' anywhere. Just keep moving.」
Mater:「Stay outside. Gotcha.」

narrator:ON ANOTHER STREET - Mater clicks along, still looking for Holley. Just as he passes the alley entrance where Finn stares down death:
HOLLEY:「OVER RADIO) You're doing brilliantly. Now just stay focused.」
Mater:「What's that? You want me to head toward that ruckus?」
narrator:Mater turns INTO the alley.
HOLLEY:「OVER RADIO) No! Don't go down that street!」
narrator:IN THE ALLEY - Finn, now nearly pushed completely into the flame thrower, leaps into the air. He FIGHTS BACK, using his wheels, axle, indeed his entire car frame as if he were human, kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies.
 Mater witnesses the whole thing.
Mater:「Wow! A live karate demonstration!」
narrator:ON THE TRACK - McQueen, now playing catch-up again, scowls.
MCQUEEN:「Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.」
narrator:IN THE BACK ALLEY - Finn polishes off the AMCs by firing a bullet into a gas main line, causing an EXPLOSION that tosses Acer through the air where he lands in a NOODLE SHOP'S SIGN.
 ON THE TRACK - The end of the race is nigh ---

BRENT MUSTANGBURGER:「V.O.) They're bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line!」
narrator:The Formula car gets there first.
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER:「V.O.) Francesco's the winner, McQueen's number two!」
narrator:IN THE ALLEY - Finn heaves breaths, surveys his damage.
Mater:「That was cool! Hey, can I get your autograph? 51.」

narrator:Mater approaches when a MASS OF RACE FANS burst out a door, momentarily blocking Mater's view of Finn. Once the fans have past, Finn has disappeared.
Mater:「Hey, where'd he go?」
HOLLEY:「OVER RADIO) Our rendezvous has been jeopardized. Keep the device safe. We'll be in touch.」
Mater:「Dadgum, did I miss our date?」

MCQUEEN:「Mater.」
Mater:「Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the race over? You won, right?」
MCQUEEN:「Mater, why were you yelling things at me while I was racing?」
Mater:「Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's funny right there. Nah, see that's `cause I seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance. It was nutso. One of them even had a flamethrower ---」
MCQUEEN:「A flamethrower? What are you talking about? I don't understand. Where were you?」
Mater:「Going to meet my date.」
MCQUEEN:「Your date?」
Mater:「She started talking to me as a voice in my head, telling me where to go ---」
MCQUEEN:「What?」
Mater:「Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you up, did I?」
MCQUEEN:「I lost the race because of you!」
Mater:「Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---」

Mater:「Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to somebody and explained what happened I could help.」

narrator:IN THE TV STUDIO - Darrell, Brent and David talk to camera.
DARRELL CARTRIP:「Well the jury may still be out on whether Allinol caused these accidents, but one thing's for sure: Lightning McQueen blew this race.」
narrator:Off a FROZEN IMAGE of McQueen crossing the finish line, a look of severe consternation across his face ---
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER:「Team McQueen can't be happy right now.」
narrator:MATCH CUT TO ---
 INT. AIRPORT - JAPAN - DAY
 McQueen's SMILING FACE, on a Team McQueen poster.
 REVERSE to reveal Mater looking at it, sadly. He drives on, passing (but not noticing) ---
 GREM and ACER.
 AT THE SECURITY CHECK - MOMENTS LATER. Cars take off their tires, move through the metal detector. Mater waits in line. A SECURITY CAR approaches Mater.
 SECURITY CAR (in Japanese and English) Come with me please, sir.
Mater:「But I'm gonna miss my plane.」

Mater:「Doggone it. This is about my hook, isn't it? I know I should've checked it, but I can't really, look -- it's attached to me.」
narrator:ZWAPPPPPP!! The Security Car suddenly DECLOAKS himself, reveals himself to be Finn McMissile!
Mater:「Hey, I know you. You're that feller from the karate demonstration.」
FINN:「I never properly introduced myself. Finn McMissile. British Intelligence.」
Mater:「Tow Mater. Average intelligence.」
FINN:「Who are you with? FBI, CIA?」
Mater:「Let's just say I'm triple-A affiliated. You know, I know some karate. I don't wanna brag or nothing, but I've got me a black fan belt.」
narrator:BEEP! Finn's rearview alarms. His camera has picked up Grem and Acer. They've just entered the lounge, are right around the corner.
Mater:「Hey, you wanna see some moves I made up?」
FINN:「You're being followed.」
narrator:Finn quickly turns, fires a tiny GLASS CUTTING BEETLE at the window. As Mater talks, oblivious, the beetle cuts out a round hole.

Mater:「This first one I can reach into a car's hood, pull out his battery, and show it to him before he stalls. I call it, "What I accidentally did to my friend Luigi once." 56.」

narrator:Mater does his best (worst) karate moves as Acer and Grem turn the corner.
GREM:「There he is!」
narrator:The glass drops away, leaving a car-sized hole.
Mater:「eyes the clock) Look, I probably ought to go. I'm about to miss my flight.」
FINN:「Don't worry.」
narrator:Finn HOOKS Mater from behind. He YANKS HIM forward ---
FINN:「I've taken care of that. Hang on.」
narrator:and LEAPS OUT THE WINDOW!
 EXT. TARMAC - AIRPORT - JAPAN
 Finn pulls Mater down HARD onto the tarmac, towing him away from the terminal.
Mater:「This is First Class service. You don't even have to go through the terminal.」
narrator:ACER and GREM appear, chasing them. Mater, who is facing backward as he is being pulled along, faces them. They're about a hundred yards back.
Mater:「TO FINN) Your karate partners are back here. They kinda look like they're trying to catch up!」

narrator:Finn, without hesitation, fires a MINI ROLLING-JACK. The jack DRIVES ITSELF toward Grem, anchors itself under his frame and flips him like a turtle but not before Grem gets the rocket OFF ---
 THE ROCKET - it flies toward Mater and Finn.
 FINN aims and launches a MISSILE back.
 THE ROCKET AND MISSILE COLLIDE IN MID-AIR, EXPLODE.
Mater:「only hearing this) Is everything okay back there?」
narrator:SIDDELEY (O.S.) Finn, it's Sid. I'm on approach.
 A GULFSTREAM JET wings into view overhead. This is SIDDELEY.
FINN:「Roger that.」
narrator:Mater looks up: ACER screeches into view up ahead, dragging a long row of luggage carts in Mater's path, attempting to create an accident.
Mater:「TO FINN) You remember that whole thing about me not stopping no matter what?」
narrator:Just as it looks dire --- RATATATATATATAT!!! SIDDELEY descends, hawklike, fires bullets and blows the luggage carts sky-high. Mater and Finn burst through them, luggage now raining down from above.
Mater:「I knew I should've done carry-on!」
FINN:「TO SIDDELEY) Thanks, old boy!」

narrator:Siddeley LANDS HARD on the tarmac ahead of them. No time to stop, he DROPS his back open, revealing HOLLEY.
Mater:「Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary girlfriend!」

narrator:Mater SPEEDS UP toward Siddeley's ramp, Holley.
Mater:「TO HOLLEY) Boy I tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya? That's a no-quit attitude right there.」
narrator:Just as Mater's wheels touch the ramp, BULLETS PING around him in a spray. Siddeley is HIT, a tire BLOWN. He yells in pain.
FINN:「Hold on, Sid!」
narrator:Siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass.
 A gunfight ensues between Finn and Acer. Finn SHOOTS ACER'S TIRE, blowing it and throwing him off-course.
 Acer CAREENS out of control, drives up and THROUGH A JET ---
 OUT THE OTHER SIDE where he lands in an oil tanker.
 ON SIDDELEY - He's headed toward the edge of the tarmac, where the grass and runway meet WATER. He HITS THE GAS, his only hope.
 SIDDELEY Finn, it's now or never!
 Finn BRAKES, 180s and grabs the ramp just as Siddeley gets air.
 SIDDELEY Hold on!
 Mater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes from our view as Siddeley climbs toward the clouds. As he's PULLED in through the back hatch:

Mater:「V.O.) By the time you read this, I will be safely on an airplane, flying home.」

MCQUEEN:「I'm so sorry for what I did. I don't want to be the cause of you losing any more races. I want you to go prove to the world what I already know - that you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world. Your best friend, Mater."」
narrator:McQueen takes this in.
MCQUEEN:「I didn't really want him to leave.」
LUIGI:「Wait, there's more here. (READS) "P.S. Please tell the hotel I didn't mean to order that movie. I thought it was just a preview and I didn't realize I was paying for it. P.P.S... That's funny right there -- PP." (to the others) There's a few more pages of P.S.'s here.」
MCQUEEN:「TURNING BACK) Well, at least I know if he's at home he'll be safe.」
narrator:EXT. SKY - DAY
 SIDDELEY breaks through some cloud cover, flies with purpose.
 INT. JET - DAY
 A well-appointed spy jet. Various computers line the walls.
FINN:「Now that's how I like to start the day! You never feel more alive than when you're almost dead.」
HOLLEY:「SCANNING MATER) I hope that device didn't fall off.」
Mater:「That's the closest I ever been to missing my flight! That was --- 60.」

narrator:With a ROBOTIC ARM, Holley grabs the THE DEVICE that Rod Redline hid under Mater. She yanks it out with a GOOSE.
Mater:「JUMPS) Yow!」
HOLLEY:「Still in one piece, great.」
narrator:Holley drops the device into a mainframe computer. It starts "ANALYZING."
Mater:「I gotta go to a doctor. I keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage.」
HOLLEY:「Downloading the photo now.」
Mater:「Hey, lemme introduce you two. (TO HOLLEY) This here is Finn McSomething-or- other. He's a First Class VIP airport whatchamacallit. And Finn, this here's my date. (TO HOLLEY) I never did get your name.」
HOLLEY:「Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell. Holley Shiftwell.」
Mater:「TO FINN) It's Shiftwell. Holley ---」

Mater:「Well, that's one of the worst engines ever made. It's an old aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot, them Whitworth bolts is a pain, tell you what. Them ain't metric, they ain't inches...」
HOLLEY:「Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is this, Mater?」
Mater:「Well, it's kinda hard to tell from this picture, ain't it?」
HOLLEY:「But you're the one who took it.」
FINN:「Holley.」
HOLLEY:「Oh, right. Yes, of course. "A good agent gets what he can, then gets out before he's killed." Sorry.」
Mater:「Agent? You mean like insurance agent, like, (SINGS) `Like a good neighbor, Mater is there'? Wait, you mean secret agents. You guys is spies!」
FINN:「Holley, in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear?」
narrator:Holley has these stats in seconds. Kid's play.
HOLLEY:「It was standard in seven models over a 12-year period. At least 35,000 cars were made with this engine.」

narrator:Mater MOVES HIS SEAT FORWARD, through one part of the hologram so he's face-to-face with Holley.
Mater:「You're pretty. 62.」

HOLLEY:「ANNOYED) Yes, alright. Thank you.」
Mater:「And so nice.」
HOLLEY:「Just pay attention.」
narrator:She moves the engine photo so it's now blocking Mater again.
FINN:「This seems like a dead end. If there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit I'd be a lot happier.」
Mater:「You might not be happy, but I bet this feller is. See how he's had most of his parts replaced? And see all them boxes over there? Them's all original parts. They ain't easy to come by.」
HOLLEY:「Rare parts.」
FINN:「That's something we can track.」
HOLLEY:「Exactly!」
narrator:Holley drops her screen down.
FINN:「Well done, Mater! I would never have seen that. (TO HOLLEY) I know of a black-market parts dealer in Paris, a treacherous lowlife. But, he's the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is. Mater, what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one?」
Mater:「Wait, what? 63.」

FINN:「You obviously have plenty of experience in the field.」
Mater:「Well yeah I live right next to one. (thinks about it) I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly been much help to anybody recently.」
FINN:「You're helping me. Please, Mater.」
Mater:「Well, okay. But you know I'm just a tow truck, right?」
FINN:「Right. And I'm just in the import/export business. Siddeley?」
narrator:SIDDELEY Yes, Finn?
FINN:「Paris. Tout de suite.」
Mater:「Yeah, two of them sweets for me too, Sid! (TO HOLLEY) You know, I always wanted to be a spy.」

narrator:The charming, low-key introduction ends with a SWEEPING VISTA of Paris's center from far away as we CRANE DOWN INTO ---
 EXT. STREET - DAY
 a dirty street in the 1st Arrondissement. Finn and Holley drive along together as Mater, playing "spy," darts back and forth behind them from doorway to dumpster, "hiding out." He's having a ball.
FINN:「TO HOLLEY) Once we're inside, stay close. Don't bother checking VIN numbers for criminal records, they're all dodgy here.」
HOLLEY:「No VIN scans. Got it.」
FINN:「Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at anyone. And absolutely, positively no idling. Are we clear?」
HOLLEY:「Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir.」
FINN:「Mater?」
Mater:「Yeah, Finn?」
FINN:「We're not here to go shopping.」
narrator:As Finn and Holley and Mater turn the corner...
Mater:「Shopping? What do you mean? Why would I ---」
narrator:Mater turns the corner and enters a massive Les Halles- inspired Parisian market filled with car parts. A tow truck's dream.
Mater:「Dadgum.」

narrator:IN THE MARKET - MOMENTS LATER
 Mater rolls along, impressed by the goods for sale.
Mater:「You gotta be kidding me - they've got everything here. Look at them hoods! I could use a hood.」
narrator:Mater continues on though, heeding Finn's advice.
Mater:「Sorry fellers, I gotta go.」
narrator:INT. ENCLOSED MARKETPLACE - DAY
 Mater, now out of sight of Finn and Holley, passes a darkened stall. He STOPS, peers in. There's someone in there.
Mater:「Excuse me. What are you selling?」
narrator:It suddenly OPENS its headlights revealing... EYES!! In French, the mutant car pitches his wares to Mater. Mater FREAKS OUT, speeds off, TERRIFIED.
 AROUND THE CORNER - FINN AND HOLLEY
 A few car lengths ahead of Mater. They roll along, looking for... Aha! Finn and Holley recede into the shadows.
 In FINN'S SIDE MIRROR: TOMBER, a three-wheeled parts dealer, argues with a French customer.
FINN:「There you are.」
narrator:Mater suddenly turns the corner, sees Finn and Holley.
Mater:「Man, there are some great ---」

FINN:「Mater, get back!」
narrator:Too late. Tomber sees Mater, then notices FINN, reflected in a hubcap. He BOLTS. Finn and Holley give chase.
Mater:「Hey, wait for me!」

narrator:Finn, hot in pursuit, leaps another obstacle and loses ground TO ---
 Tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to grill with HOLLEY. He whips to the left but TURNS OVER, rolling sideways and CRASHING to a stop.
 Holley ZAPS him with ELECTROSHOCKERS. Finn suddenly arrives, stops her.
FINN:「TO HOLLEY) Have you lost your mind?!」
HOLLEY:「But I thought ---」
FINN:「Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook him up.」
Mater:「Sure thing. CUT TO:」

Mater:「Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't nothing truer than that.」
FINN:「Lemon?"」
Mater:「Yeah, you know. Cars that don't ever work right. Lemons is a tow truck's bread and butter. Like them Gremlins and Pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport.」
FINN:「Holley, pull up the pictures from the oil platform. I want to know what other type of cars were out there.」
narrator:Holley complies and suddenly PHOTOS OF CARS FROM THE OIL PLATFORM hang suspended in the air in front of them.
HOLLEY:「Right. Let's see. There were Hugos. And Trunkovs.」
FINN:「Mater, are these cars considered lemons?」
Mater:「Is the Popemobile Catholic?」

TOMBER:「Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkovs never get together. But they're having a secret meeting in two days.」
FINN:「Where's this meeting taking place?」
TOMBER:「Porto Corsa, Italy.」
Mater:「That's where the next race is!」
FINN:「Then there's a good chance our mystery engine will be there too.」
TOMBER:「Your chances are more than good. I just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday... to Porto Corsa.」
FINN:「Holley, contact Stephenson and have him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good work.」
narrator:EXT. FRENCH ALPS - NIGHT
 STEPHENSON, a THREE-CAR LUXURY BULLET TRAIN speeds along a snow-covered mountain in the dead of night, its halogen headlight cutting through the darkness. It DIPS into a TUNNEL ---
Mater:「O.S.) Boy, I'll tell you what. That three- wheeled feller had to be right about a big meeting.」
narrator:INT. SPY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
 Mater, Finn and Holley scroll through surveillance-style photos of TRAFFIC on an Italian street. They're in the front train car, which doubles as a luxury seating area and intelligence command center.

Mater:「You never see this many lemons in one town. Unless there's a swap meet, or something. (TO HOLLEY) (MORE) 70.
 Hey, how'd you get all them pictures?」
HOLLEY:「Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto Corsa's red light cameras to do recognition scans.」
Mater:「Wow, not only is you the prettiest car I ever met, but you the smartest too.」
HOLLEY:「Thank you. I think.」
Mater:「That's a familiar sight.」
narrator:Mater refers to a photo of VICTOR HUGO, the HUGO Lemonhead, being towed by an EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK.
Mater:「A Hugo being towed. But he looks absolutely perfect.」
FINN:「Of course. They must be the heads of the lemon families.」
Mater:「Makes sense. If I was rich and broke down every day, I'd hire me to tow me around all the time too.」
FINN:「We've got to infiltrate that meeting. It's the only way to find out who's behind all this.」
HOLLEY:「EYEING MATER) Hang on a minute.」
Mater:「What?」
HOLLEY:「Hold still.」

narrator:Holley SNAPS Mater's picture, temporarily blinding him.
Mater:「Ahh! 71.」

narrator:Holley turns back to her monitor. Mater's face appears on screen. She quickly GRAFTS it over the Hugo's tow truck's.
FINN:「Good job, Miss Shiftwell.」
narrator:Holley isn't sure what surprises her more: the compliment or how pleased it makes her.
HOLLEY:「Thank you, Finn.」
Mater:「Boy, I sure wish my friends could see me now.」

Mater:「What? I thought you was supposed to be making me a disguise.」
MATER'S COMPUTER:「Voice recognized. Disguise Program Initiated.」
narrator:ZWWWWAT! A HOLOGRAPHIC disguise suddenly umbrellas out, emitted from Mater's roof. It drops a clean cloaking image of the EASTERN EUROPEAN TOW TRUCK over Mater.
Mater:「Cool! Hey, computer. Make me a German truck!」
MATER'S COMPUTER:「Request acknowledged.」
narrator:ZWATTTT! Mater suddenly wears lederhosen and a German hat.
Mater:「Check it out. I'm wearing Materhosen. Make me a monster truck!」
MATER'S COMPUTER:「Request acknowledged.」
narrator:He's transformed into Dracula, complete with fangs.
Mater:「ALA DRACULA) I vant to siphon your gas. Now make me a taco truck!」
MATER'S COMPUTER:「Request acknowledged.」
Mater:「A funny car!」

Mater:「So I just go in, pretend to be this truck.」
FINN:「And leave the rest to us.」
HOLLEY:「Now hold still.」
narrator:Holley turns back to her work. The disguise's cloaking is larger than Mater. As a result, Holley must dial it back to fit his body. As she carefully calibrates the hologram:
HOLLEY:「I have to do the final fitting on your disguise.」
narrator:Holley STOPS. The 3D disguise is now flush with his frame, but dents SHOW THROUGH.
HOLLEY:「Oh dear. That's no good.」
narrator:She deploys A BONDO SPRAYER on a robotic arm, moves it toward one of Mater's DENTS. Mater pulls away.
Mater:「Hey, what are you doing?」
HOLLEY:「The disguise won't calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto.」
Mater:「Oh. For a second there I thought you was trying to fix my dents.」
HOLLEY:「I was.」
Mater:「Well then no thank you. I don't get them dents buffed, pulled, filled or painted by nobody. They're way too valuable.」
HOLLEY:「Your dents are valuable?」

Mater:「I come by each one of them with my best friend Lightning McQueen. (MORE) 77.
 I don't fix these. I want to remember these dents forever.」
HOLLEY:「So you were being serious in Paris? McQueen isn't just part of your cover?」
FINN:「Friendships can be dangerous in our line of work, Mater.」
Mater:「But my line of work is towing and salvage.」
FINN:「Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is designing iPhone apps.」
Mater:「No, I meant for real. I ---」

IVAN THE TOW TRUCK:「Oh really? Prove it.」
HOLLEY:「No, no, don't fight over me.」
narrator:Holley directs her interest toward Ivan.
HOLLEY:「Signore Tow Truck, per favore? CUT TO:」
narrator:MATER - He watches this from a safe hiding spot around a corner.
FINN:「V.O.) Get ready, Mater. CUT TO:」
narrator:FINN, at an outdoor cafe on the casino grounds.
FINN:「You're on any moment now. CUT BACK TO:」
narrator:MATER, now looking a bit nervous. He backs out of sight.
Mater:「I don't know about this, Finn. What if I screw things up?」
FINN:「OVER RADIO) Impossible. Just apply the same level of dedication you've been using to play the "idiot tow truck" and you'll be fine.」
Mater:「It's just that them guys look pretty tough and --- Wait, did you say "idiot"? Is that how you see me?」

narrator:ZZZZATTT! Mater jumps at the sound, turns in time to see Ivan SHOCKED UNCONSCIOUS by Holley's ZAPPERS.
HOLLEY:「Why aren't you in disguise?」
Mater:「I, uh---」
HOLLEY:「Come on, there's no time. Go!」
Mater:「Okay, okay. Computer: disguise.」

narrator:INT. CASINO - DAY
 Cars play craps with FUZZY DICE; slot machines with odometers for jackpot numbers; cigarette girls sell car items.
 CIGARETTE GIRL CAR Air Freshener, antenna balls, sparkplugs...
 ON MATER - He tows VICTOR. They are flanked on all four corners by Hugo thugs, ala a presidential motorcade. The largess of the interior design seems to finally snap Mater out of his funk.
Mater:「WIDE-EYED) Wow, this place looks like it's made out of gold.」
narrator:The Hugos on either side of Mater exchange a look.
HOLLEY:「OVER RADIO) That's because it is, Mater. Now, be careful what you say.」
Mater:「Why is that? What do you mean don't talk to you? (more talking from Holley which we cannot hear) So you want me to stop talking to you. Right now?」
ALEXANDER HUGO:「You are acting strange today, Ivan.」
Mater:「I have no idea what you're talking about...」
narrator:MATER'S P.O.V. - A digital readout isolates the Hugo and starts to scroll reams of information alongside.
Mater:「Alexander Hugo, aka "Chop Shop Alex."」

Mater:「Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex. But I guess that makes sense seeings how you's wanted in France, Germany, the Czech Republic...」

PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP:「A toast! To the death of Allinol and alternative fuel forever!」
narrator:EXT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS
 Holley is already on the run. Speeding away.
HOLLEY:「Mater. Abort the mission. They've got Finn. Get out of there. Get out of there right now!」
narrator:She turns a corner and STOPS.
 Her escape is now blocked by the same HUGO THUGS she tricked before. Another vehicle appears BEHIND HER, LOOMS.
IVAN THE TOW TRUCK:「How is your grandfather?」
narrator:INT. PRIVATE ROOM - CASINO - CONTINUOUS
 The Lemonheads celebrate, chant "Long live lemons!" Mater, scared, turns to leave. He's stopped by ALEXANDER HUGO.
ALEXANDER HUGO:「Isn't this a great party, Ivan?」
Mater:「Oh yeah, it's unbelievable.」
ALEXANDER HUGO:「You are not leaving, are you?」
Mater:「Uh, of course I ain't leavin'.」
MCQUEEN:「O.S.) I'm just in shock like everybody...」
Mater:「McQueen?」

DARRELL CARTRIP:「ON TV) They're letting you choose your fuel for the final race. Do you have any idea what it's going to be?」
MCQUEEN:「ON TV) Allinol.」
narrator:The excitement suddenly DRAINS from the room.
 LEMONHEADS - What?! - Did he just say Allinol? After today?
MCQUEEN:「ON TV) My friend Fillmore says the fuel's safe. That's good enough for me. I didn't stand by a friend of mine recently. I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.」
narrator:On Mater. He takes this in.
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER:「ON TV) So a surprising revelation from Lightning McQueen...」
narrator:Zundapp is already on the phone with their Big Boss who, based on his angry O.S. voice, sounds ticked off.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP:「Yes, sir. Of course.」
narrator:Zundapp hangs up, turns to the room.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP:「Allinol must be finished for good. McQueen cannot win the last race. Lightning McQueen must be killed.」
narrator:Mater's eyes open wide.
Mater:「No!」

narrator:The thugs DRAW TERRIFYING WEAPONS.
Mater:「Dadgum.」
MATER'S COMPUTER:「Gatling gun" request acknowledged.」
narrator:WHIRRRRR! GUNS roll out of Mater on each side.
Mater:「Shoot. I didn't mean ---」
MATER'S COMPUTER:「Request acknowledged.」
narrator:Mater SPRAYS BULLETS into the crowd.
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV:「Get down!」
Mater:「Whoa!!」
narrator:The Lemons and Lemonheads hit the deck and RETURN FIRE ---
 Mater is THROWN BACKWARD by the force of the guns, back through some double doors and onto a BALCONY.
Mater:「Wait wait! I didn't mean that kind of shoot!」
MATER'S COMPUTER:「Correction acknowledged. Deploying chute.」
narrator:WHOOM! A PARACHUTE BURSTS out of the back of Mater, he catches air and is YANKED INTO THE SKY!
 The Lemonheads watch him float away, amazed.
 ON MATER, out of the frying pan but still toasty. He looks around, notices:
 LIGHTNING MCQUEEN, far away, leaving the press podium.
Mater:「McQueen!」

narrator:ITALIAN MOTORBOAT Aspetti!
 The motorboat isn't happy about this, tries to shake him. Mater is THROWN INTO A "HOTEL" sign, then SMASHES down through a Francesco souvenir stand. As he CRASHES onto the ground hard, we SMASH CUT TO ---
 EXT. SECURITY CHECKPOINT - WINNERS CIRCLE
 a barricade. Separating the press from the public, ITALIAN SECURITY TRUCKS stand guard.
Mater:「Lemme through! Lemme through!」
narrator:MATER barrels around a corner. He's now covered in Francesco memorabilia and palm leaves. The word `HOT' now dangles off him like the world's biggest bling. He looks INSANE.
Mater:「TO SECURITY) You gotta let me in! I gotta get through to warn McQueen!」
narrator:Security eyes one another. This is serious.
 ITALIAN SECURITY #1 You cannot come through here. Back up, signore.
 ITALIAN SECURITY #2 (into a walkie-talkie) We have a lunatic at Gate Nove.
Mater:「No, listen! I was disguised as a tow truck to infiltrate this Lemonhead meeting and my weapons system misinterperated what I was SAYING ---」

narrator:ITALIAN SECURITY #2 I repeat. Lunatic at Gate Nove.
 Mater spots McQueen far off in the distance.
Mater:「McQueen! McQueen!」

Mater:「O.S.) (DISTANT) McQueen!」
MCQUEEN:「Mater?」
narrator:McQueen looks up but can only see A SEA OF VEHICLES, flashbulbs, cameras, TV trucks with those tall satellite antennae things that spindle toward the sky...
 BACK AT THE SECURITY BARRICADE - Mater, like a nimble running back, dances around to avoid capture by security.
Mater:「McQueen!」
narrator:ITALIAN SECURITY #1 Back up, sir. Stop moving! Stop!
 Mater head fakes them and pushes through, into the crowd ---
 ITALIAN SECURITY #1 Oy! Stop! Ferma li!
 IN THE CROWD - Mater shoves his way through. He's still far in the back.
Mater:「McQueen!」
narrator:ON MCQUEEN
MCQUEEN:「That really sounded like Mater. Mater?」
narrator:PRESS LIAISON (TO MCQUEEN) Signore...
 ON MATER, getting CLOSER...
Mater:「McQueen, they're gonna kill you!!」

IVAN THE TOW TRUCK:「TO MCQUEEN) In England you'll be finished. At the finish line.」
narrator:Ivan is now obscured again.
MCQUEEN:「Wait, what?」
narrator:The ITALIAN PRESS being to swarm.
 PRESS LIAISON Please, the world press is waiting. You come with me, please.
 McQueen is pulled back ---
 EXT. STREET - PORTO CORSA - MOMENTS LATER
 just as Mater, now BOUND and with HIS MOUTH TAPED, is pulled away and thrown into the back of a transport vehicle. He lands hard on his side, spits out his TAPE.
Mater:「Let me go!」
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP:「You actually care about that race car. A pity you didn't warn him in time.」
narrator:As the doors close on Mater --- PHHHHHSSSSSSTTTTTTT! A thick, noxious gas starts to fill the truck.
 On MATER as the knockout gas works its magic. HIS EYES CLOSE. CUT TO:
 BLACK SCREEN.
Mater:「V.O.) Idiot? Is that how you see me?」

FINN:「OVER RADIO) No one realizes they're being fooled because they're too busy laughing at the fool.」
narrator:IN THE KABUKI THEATER IN JAPAN - Again, from before. Mater makes a spectacle of himself, WHOOPING AND HOLLERING in the stands with the face paint on.
Mater:「Domo arigato!」
narrator:McQueen, Fillmore, Guido, Luigi, Sarge and patrons eye Mater, embarrassed and angry.
 IN THE JAPANESE MUSEUM - The moment of Mater banging on the Zen rock garden's glass. Except that now we see all sorts of disappointed and eyebrow raising reactions.
Mater:「You done good! You got all the leaves!」
narrator:JEFF GORVETTE Check out that tow truck.
 LEWIS HAMILTON I wonder who that guy's with?
MCQUEEN:「HUMILIATED) Will you guys excuse me just for one little second?」
narrator:We now REVEAL that this FLOATING, THIRD PERSON PERSPECTIVE is MATER. He's INSIDE his past, watching it from others' points of view. He doesn't like what he sees.
 ON MATER, now at the sushi bar.
Mater:「Now that's a scoop of ice cream!」

narrator:ALL THE RACERS, with FRANCESCO front and center, guffaw at Mater.
 On MCQUEEN, now scolding Mater moments later.
Mater:「I never leak oil. Never.」
MCQUEEN:「Mater, you have to get a hold of yourself. You're making a scene!」
narrator:IN MCQUEEN'S PIT GARAGE, after the Japanese race.
Mater:「Wait a minute. I didn't screw you up, did I?」
MCQUEEN:「I lost the race because of you!」
Mater:「Maybe if I talked to somebody, or---」
MCQUEEN:「I don't need your help. I don't want your help!」
narrator:Now BACK AT THE PARTY, a moment we didn't see before but which presumably happened. Mater is BANGING a ceremonial GONG, to the horror of Japanese guests.
Mater:「Bang a gong, get it on!」

narrator:All around him, all he sees are GIANT PIECES OF MECHANIZED CLOCKWORK.
 HOLLEY and FINN are here too, strapped bumper to bumper in the divots of large clock movements.
Mater:「Holley! Finn! Where are we?」
FINN:「We're in London, Mater. Inside Big Bentley.」
narrator:EXT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS
 The BIG HAND finishes ADVANCING one minute. It's 3 PM.
 INT. BIG BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS
 Suddenly Mater DROPS QUICKLY down toward ---
 whirring, scary machinery.
Mater:「Woaaaah! ---」
narrator:WHAP! The chain yanks to a STOP.
 Mater, instead of being 30 feet from death, is now 20.
 Finn and Holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed themselves. The clock ticks to 3:01.
Mater:「This... this is all my fault.」
FINN:「Don't be a fool, Mater.」
Mater:「But I am, remember? You said so.」
FINN:「When did I... Oh. Mater, I was complimenting you on what a good spy you are.」
Mater:「I'm not a spy!」

Mater:「I've been trying to tell you that the whole time. I really am just a tow truck.」
narrator:Finn and Holley take this in.
HOLLEY:「Finn, he's not joking.」
FINN:「I know.」
Mater:「You were right, Finn. I'm a fool. And what's happened to McQueen is `cause I'm such a big one. This is all my fault.」
narrator:GREM and ACER arrive on a lift, roll into view on a catwalk.
GREM:「Good, you're up!」
ACER:「And just in time!」
GREM:「Professor Z wanted you to have a front row seat for the death of Lightning McQueen.」
Mater:「HOPEFUL) He's still alive?」

ACER:「You broke it.」
GREM:「Quiet! (INTO RADIO) I understand, sir. Yes.」
narrator:Grem hangs up.
ACER:「What'd he say?」
GREM:「We go to the backup plan.」
Mater:「Backup plan??」
GREM:「We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit!」
ACER:「The next time he makes a stop, instead of saying "ka-chow," he's gonna go "ka-boom"!」
narrator:They LAUGH. Mater shudders, upset.
GREM:「Don't feel bad, tow truck. You couldn't have saved him.」
ACER:「Oh, wait. You could have!」
narrator:Grem and Acer laugh. As they board the elevator:
Mater:「Dadgum lemons.」

narrator:CLOSE ON WHAT MATER SEES: A small piece of his ropes have been shaved away by the Gatling.
 He carefully rotates his guns BACK IN, pretending like he's seen nothing.
ACER:「That's right! You got nothin'.」
GREM:「as the elevator descends) Who's the lemon now, huh?」
narrator:They're GONE.
FINN:「Nice try, Mater.」
Mater:「Dadgum!」
MATER'S COMPUTER:「REQUEST ACK-」
narrator:The guns ROTATE OUT AGAIN, SPIN. Mater watches as the spinning barrels SLICE INTO the ropes, do some damage.
Mater:「Dadgum! Dadgum! Dadgum!」
narrator:The COMPUTER responds with each "dadgum." The barrels continue to SPIN, CUTTING THROUGH the ropes.
Mater:「DADGUMDADGUMDADGUMDADGUM ---」
narrator:PING! The ropes BREAK AWAY and Mater FALLS --- right toward the whirring machinery!
HOLLEY:「Mater!」
narrator:Mater QUICKLY WHIPS his tow cable around, hooks a pipe and tosses himself to the ramp with a heavy THUD. He doesn't HESITATE:

Mater:「I gotta get you all out of there!」

Mater:「But I can't, I'm just a tow truck.」
FINN:「It's up to you. Go to the pits and get everyone out. You can do that.」
Mater:「What about you guys?」

narrator:Holley JUICES the gearbox with HIGH VOLTAGE. The CLOCK STOPS. It reverses itself.
 Finn and Holley's wheel now rotates AWAY from danger.
FINN:「Good job! Quick thinking, Holley!」
narrator:EXT. LONDON - CONTINUOUS
 BIG BENTLEY, visible from street level, now moves BACKWARDS. Fast. CRANE DOWN TO ---
 Mater, speeding toward the track, unaware.
Mater:「What's everybody on the wrong side of the road for?!」

FINN:「IMPRESSED) Miss Shiftwell.」
HOLLEY:「They're standard issue now.」
FINN:「You kids get all the good hardware.」
narrator:They turn to leave when they STOP, see SOMETHING. It's an AIR FILTER on the ground.
HOLLEY:「Oh no. That's Mater's.」
FINN:「I knew his escape was too easy.」
narrator:EXT. BIG BENTLEY - LONDON
 Finn BURSTS out the front doors of Big Bentley, speeds off as HOLLEY SMASHES through the clock face, careens into view flying over the traffic ---
 INT. PIT ROW - TRACK SIDE - DAY
 Mater bursts through the security gate with aplomb, tears through the pits and stops at MCQUEEN'S.
LUIGI:「Mater!」
Mater:「Everybody get out! Get out now! Y'all gotta get out the pits!」
narrator:The ENTIRE RADIATOR SPRINGS GANG is here.
Mater:「Hey, what are you guys doing here?」
SALLY:「We're here because of you, Mater.」
FLO:「Is everything okay?」
Mater:「No! Everything's not okay! There's a bomb in here! Y'all gotta get out! Now! 111.」

narrator:EVERYONE - A bomb? - Huh? - Woah.
FINN:「OVER RADIO) Mater!」
Mater:「INTO RADIO) Finn! You're okay!」
narrator:EXT. LONDON STREETS - CONTINUOUS
FINN:「Mater, listen to me. The bomb is on you.」
narrator:ON HIS REARVIEW DISPLAY: We can see that a BOMB has been detected, anchored to Mater's air filter.
FINN:「They knew you'd try to help McQueen. When we were knocked out they planted it in your air filter.」
narrator:INT. MCQUEEN'S PIT - CONTINUOUS
 Mater SNORTS, blowing his air filter cover off. Cross-eyed, Mater sees the explosive device attached to him. He looks up:
 An ALLINOL CONTAINER hangs ominously over his head.
Mater:「Uh-oh.」
MCQUEEN:「Mater! There you are!」
narrator:Mater turns. McQueen enters Pit Row, 100 yards away and closing in FAST.
Mater:「Stop right there!」

narrator:INT. MCQUEEN'S PIT - CONTINUOUS
Mater:「Don't come any closer!」
MCQUEEN:「Are you okay?」
Mater:「No, I'm not okay. Stay away from me!!」

Mater:「Stay back! If you get close to me, you gonna get hurt real bad!」
MCQUEEN:「I know I made you feel that way before, but none of that matters because we're best friends! CUT TO:」
narrator:TV FOOTAGE OF MCQUEEN CHASING MATER
BRENT MUSTANGBURGER:「V.O.) And McQueen seems to be having a conversation with the tow truck!」
DARRELL CARTRIP:「V.O.) I don't know who that truck is, Brent. But I'll tell you what, he's gotta be the world's best backwards driver.」
narrator:REVEAL ZUNDAPP is watching this footage from his luxury box. The closer McQueen gets to Mater the farther his tire ROLLS onto the detonator. But he holds back ever so slightly so as not to jump the gun.
 ON THE TRACK - McQueen gains on Mater.
Mater:「McQueen, you don't get it. I'm the bomb!」
MCQUEEN:「Yes, Mater! You are the bomb! That's what I'm trying to say here. You've always been the bomb! And you'll always be the bomb.」
Mater:「Stay away!」

narrator:He's going to catch him now.
MCQUEEN:「get away again!」
narrator:McQueen JUMPS FORWARD, in an attempt to grab Mater's HOOK ---
Mater:「TO HIMSELF) Gotta keep away from McQueen.」

narrator:COMBAT SHIP Hurry, Professor!
 ON ZUNDAPP - With Finn gaining fast, he accelerates. Suddenly --- WHAP!
 He's been TETHERED by Finn with tensile cables now attached to his rear end. Zundapp SCREAMS like a little girl.
FINN:「Do you really think I'm going to let you float away, Professor?」
narrator:Finn reels him in. Zundapp spins his wheels, caught.
 Suddenly Zundapp miraculously, inconceivably, GAINS TRACTION! Now it's FINN'S WHEELS that are spinning.
 ON THE COMBAT SHIP - the ELECTROMAGNET has been turned outward and switched on. He's PULLING ZUNDAPP AND FINN IN with the magnetic force. He pulls out a laser, TARGETS it at Finn's windshield. CUT TO:
 EXT. LONDON STREETS - SAME
 Mater, still towing McQueen, rockets around a corner, zips down another street ---
Mater:「McQueen, let go!」

narrator:THE MAGNET SUCKS it in quickly like a black hole ---
 THUNK! It all sticks to the magnet, right next to Finn's bullets. They're BOMBS, GRENADES, ROCKETS and one little detonator with a flashing, beeping light.
 Off the boat's RXN --- CUT TO:
 ANOTHER PART OF LONDON, AT STREET LEVEL
 KA-BOOOOOOM! A distant explosion (miles away) festoons into the air, visible over the rooftops. Holley suddenly WINGS into view. She sees ---
 Mater and McQueen, speeding up the street.
HOLLEY:「Mater, stop!」
Mater:「No way! You could get hurt!」

narrator:She's already SCANNING the bomb, working away.
MCQUEEN:「Bomb?」
Mater:「Yeah, they strapped it to me to kill you as a back-up plan.」
MCQUEEN:「Back-up plan? Mater, who put a bomb on you?」
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP:「O.S.) Ahhhhh!」
narrator:Professor Zundapp suddenly ROLLS to a stop next to (a now totally freaked) McQueen, entangled in grappling hooks care OF ---
 Finn, who has him leashed.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP:「TO MCQUEEN) You. Why didn't my death ray kill you?」
MCQUEEN:「Death ray?」
FINN:「Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!」
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP:「Are you all so dense? It's voice- activated. Everything is voice- activated these days.」
Mater:「Deactivate! Deactivate!」

HOLLEY:「Say it!」
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP:「Deactivate.」
narrator:BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE Voice denied.
 THE BOMB'S TIMER: It loses a full minute! Goes from 4:48 to 3:48 to 3:47... Mater GASPS.
PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP:「GRINNING) I am not the one who activated it. Would anyone else like to try?」
narrator:ZZZZZZATTT! Holley shocks him unconscious.
FINN:「TO HOLLEY) You read my mind.」
HOLLEY:「He was getting on my nerves.」
MCQUEEN:「What do we do?」
VICTOR HUGO:「O.S.) It's very simple.」
narrator:VICTOR HUGO blocks the entrance to a side street. He's surrounded by Hugo relatives.
VICTOR HUGO:「You blow up.」
narrator:The four streets surrounding them are now blocked by each of the Lemonheads and their families.
MCQUEEN:「TO MATER) I'm gonna go out on a limb here. These are the guys that want me dead, correct?」
VLADIMIR TRUNKOV:「It's nothing personal.」
Mater:「to the Lemons) Fellers, listen. (MORE) 120.
 I know what you're going through. Everybody's been laughing at me my whole life too ---」

narrator:McQueen turns to Mater - he wasn't expecting that.
 The Lemons all eye each other, considering Mater's words.
Mater:「but becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams ain't gonna make you feel better.」

TUBBS PACER:「Retreat!」
narrator:A few Lemons turn back the way they came. BLOCKING THEIR PATH are a line of BRITISH MILITARY VEHICLES clad in digital camo, led by SARGE.
SARGE:「Thanks for the help, Corporal.」
narrator:BRITISH CORPORAL Anything for one of pop's mates.
 And in the middle of all of this craziness we CUT TO ---
 MATER. WRENCH BITS are strewn all around him as Guido tries wrench after wrench to take the bolts off. No dice. Guido gestures wildly, spits Italian a mile a minute.
MCQUEEN:「What's he saying?! What's wrong!?」
LUIGI:「None of his wrenches fit the bolts!」
narrator:This is a light bulb moment for Mater. He eyes the bolts.
Mater:「I get it. I get it! I know what needs to be done.」
MCQUEEN:「Then do it!」
Mater:「What? No, I can't do it. Look, nobody takes me seriously. I know that now. This ain't Radiator Springs.」

Mater:「Thanks, buddy.」
MCQUEEN:「No no no, you're the actual bomb. Now let's go!」
Mater:「Oh, right! Hang on!」
narrator:Mater HOOKS McQueen and they're off.
 They SHOOT PAST FINN, who's in the middle of battling lemons.
FINN:「Where's he going?」
narrator:ON MATER AND MCQUEEN - Flying down a side street.
Mater:「Computer!」
MATER'S COMPUTER:「Yes, Agent Mater.」
Mater:「I need that thing you done before to get me away from McQueen!」
MATER'S COMPUTER:「Request acknowledged.」
narrator:The ROCKET THRUSTERS kick in. They head right for a WALL.
MCQUEEN:「Mater...」
Mater:「Now I need you to do the chute, the second kind not the first!」

narrator:QUEEN Who's winning the race?
 Mater and McQueen drop from the sky. They land and skid to a halt just before the Queen's guards who DRAW THEIR WEAPONS.
 QUEEN'S GUARD Back up! Back away!
 QUEEN (STAR-STRUCK) It's Lightning McQueen!
 QUEEN'S GUARDS Get back!
MCQUEEN:「No, no, it's okay! Tell them, Mater. Explain.」
Mater:「Okay! Somebody's been sabotaging the racers and hurting the cars and I know who. Oh wait... Your Majesty.」
narrator:Mater BOWS to the Queen. In doing so, the TICKING TIME BOMB angles into view. The clock's at T-minus 1:53.
 QUEEN'S GUARDS - Bomb! - It's a bomb! - Everybody down! - Look out!
FINN:「O.S.) Hold your fire! He can't disarm it!」
narrator:Finn dives onto the platform and rolls between the Queen and Mater.
FINN:「Mater, I don't know what you're doing but stand down now!」
Mater:「aside, to McQueen) This ain't nothing at all like Radiator Springs.」
MCQUEEN:「Mater, just cut to the chase!」
Mater:「Okay. 124.」

narrator:He turns to Miles Axlerod.
Mater:「It's him.」
MILES AXLEROD:「What? Me? You've got to be crazy.」
narrator:Everyone exchanges confused looks, including Finn and Holley.
Mater:「I figured it out when I realized you all attached this ticking time bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same bolts that hold together that old British engine from the photograph. Holley! Show that picture.」
HOLLEY:「O-kay...」
narrator:Holley projects the much discussed PHOTO OF THE ENGINE.
Mater:「And then I remembered what they say about old British engines - "If there ain't no oil under `em, there ain't no oil in `em."」
MILES AXLEROD:「What is he talking about?」
Mater:「It was you leaking oil at the party in Japan. You just blamed it on me.」
MILES AXLEROD:「Electric cars don't use oil, you twit.」
Mater:「Then you're faking it. You didn't convert to no electric. We pop that hood we gonna see that engine from that picture right there.」

MILES AXLEROD:「Stay away!」
HOLLEY:「But Sir Axlerod created the race, Mater. Why would he want to hurt anyone?」
Mater:「To make Allinol look bad so everybody'd go back to using oil. I mean, he said it himself with that disguised voice.」
MILES AXLEROD:「Dee-sguised voice?" What are you talking about? You're nuts, you are!」
narrator:The QUEEN'S GUARDS have had ENOUGH. As has the PRINCE.
 PRINCE WHEELIAM This is going nowhere fast. We really should go, Grandmother.
 QUEEN One moment. I'd like to see where this is going.
FINN:「Mater, he created Allinol.」
Mater:「Yeah, but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else?」
narrator:Mater sticks his ticking bomb-nose into Miles Axlerod's grill.
Mater:「What if he came up with Allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad?」

MCQUEEN:「TO MATER) It's official. You're coming to all my races from now on.」
Mater:「Now you're talking!」
narrator:Tire bump.
 EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
 A massive crowd packs the adjacent streets and parks.
 INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
 Mater does the requisite "silly faces" in an attempt to break the composure of a Buckingham Palace Guard. It isn't working. McQueen approaches.
MCQUEEN:「Mater, let's go. You're on.」
narrator:INT. QUEEN'S CHAMBER - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY
 The Queen sits in attention at the front of the Main Ballroom. As Mater and McQueen approach:
 LORD STEWARD Your Majesty. May I present for the investiture of honorary Knighthood of the British Realm. Tow Mater of Radiator Springs.
MCQUEEN:「Go get `em, buddy.」
narrator:McQueen joins his friends from Radiator Springs. Mater rolls forward. He bows, as if he's practiced it all day.
 QUEEN I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater."
 Applause from all around.

Mater:「LOOKS UP) "Sir?" Shoot, you can just call me Mater, Your Majesty. I don't wanna hear none of this "Sir" business. By the way, have y'all met each other? Queen? McQueen. McQueen, Queen. McQueen? McMissile. (MORE) 128.
 McMissile, McQueen. Queen? McMissile.」
narrator:He continues introducing everyone as we CUT TO ---
 EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY
 The town sign now reads "WELCOME TO RADIATOR SPRINGS - HOME OF LIGHTNING MCQUEEN AND SIR TOW MATER."
 EXT. FLO'S - DAY
 Cars surround Mater and McQueen. The rest of the Radiator Springs gang is here too, watches. VAN and MINNY are front and center.
Mater:「So there I was: rocket jets going full blast, McQueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere, guns drawed. We was goners. But then out of nowhere, this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us!」
narrator:MINNY That's a very entertaining story, young man.
 VAN Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of this happened. Rocket jets? Flying spy cars?

HOLLEY:「No, you're quite right. It does sound a bit far-fetched.」
narrator:The crowd turns, sees HOLLEY, wings out, swooping in. FINN is right below her, driving up the street.
Mater:「Holley! Finn!」
HOLLEY:「Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see you again.」
Mater:「What're you doing here? 129.」

FINN:「Our satellites picked up an urgent communique.」
LUIGI:「So you got my e-mail.」
Mater:「Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a great time. Everybody! This here's Finn McMissile. He's a secret agent. (WHISPERS) Don't tell nobody. And this is Holley Shiftwell. She's ---」

HOLLEY:「Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent. It's way too valuable.」
narrator:Mater takes this in.
 LIZZIE A "valuable" dent? Oh, she's as crazy as Mater.
 MACK Those two are perfect for each other.
MCQUEEN:「You know, there's one thing I still don't get. The bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera, right? So why didn't I, you know...」
Mater:「Explode in a fiery inferno?」

narrator:EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER
 The racers at the starting grid. ON THE TRAFFIC LIGHT in the center of town. It goes from RED to GREEN!
 The RACERS SPEED OFF, tearing up main street and out of town, blazing past tourists ---
 EXT. WILLY'S BUTTE - DAY
 As the racers, led by McQueen and Francesco, take the wide, sweeping turn around Willy's Butte we CRANE UP to see MATER, FINN, HOLLEY, and the Radiator Springs gang watching. Everyone CHEERS.
Mater:「Go McQueen!! Whoo-hoo!!!」
narrator:Holley gets an alert.
HOLLEY:「Finn, time to go. Siddeley's gassed, geared and ready to fly.」
narrator:Finn starts to back up.
Mater:「You're leaving already?」
FINN:「We've got another mission, Mater. Just stopped by here to "pick something up."」
narrator:They both eye Mater, expectantly.
Mater:「Something tells me you're not talking about souvenir bumper stickers.」
FINN:「Her Majesty asked for you personally, Mater.」
Mater:「But I told you all before. I'm not a spy.」

FINN:「Spy or not, you're still the smartest, most honest chap we've ever met.」
HOLLEY:「Don't forget massively charming.」
narrator:Mater looks over at Holley. He looks touched.
Mater:「Well, thanks. But as much fun as it was hanging with y'all, this...」
narrator:He looks over to his friends who watch the race, CHEER MCQUEEN ON.
Mater:「This is home.」
HOLLEY:「That's alright, we understand. But I'll be back. You still owe me that first date.」
FINN:「If there's ever anything I can do for you, just let me know.」
Mater:「Well, I sure appreciate that, thank you. (THINKS) Actually... there is one thing. CUT TO:」

Mater:「KEEPING PACE) Check it out. They let me keep the rockets!」
MCQUEEN:「I'll see you at the finish line, buddy!」
Mater:「Not if I see you first!」
