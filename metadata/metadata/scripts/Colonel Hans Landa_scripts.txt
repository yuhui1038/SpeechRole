Colonel Hans Landa:「Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame, at your service. He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess hand...
 please excuse my rude intrusion on your routine.」
narrator:FARMERS WIFE Don't be ridiculous, heer Col. While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her eyes, The S.S. Colonel says;
Colonel Hans Landa:「Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true. Your wife is a beautiful woman. His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters.」

Colonel Hans Landa:「Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine. This being a dairy farm one would be safe in assuming you have milk?」
narrator:CHARLOTTE Oui.
Colonel Hans Landa:「Then milk is what I prefer.」
narrator:CHARLOTTE Very Well. The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box, and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel. The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down LOUDLY on the wooden table.
Colonel Hans Landa:「Monsieur, to both your family, and your cows, I say; Bravo.」
PERRIER:「Merci.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Please, join me at your table.」
PERRIER:「Very well. The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from The Nazi. The Women remain standing. Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of」

PERRIER:「to his women) Charlotte, would you take the girls outside. The Colonel and I need to have a few words. The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them. The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers humble home.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French. To continue to speak it so inadequately, would only serve to embarrass me. However, I've been lead to believe you speak English quite well?」
PERRIER:「Oui.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Well, it just so happens, I do as well. This being your house, I ask your permission to switch to English, for the remainder of the conversation?」
PERRIER:「By all means. They now speak ENGLISH;」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very familiar with you, and your family. I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am. Are you aware of my existence? The Farmer answers;」
PERRIER:「Yes.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「This is good. Are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?」

narrator:I
PERRIER:「Yes. The Colonel drinks more milk.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Please tell me what you've heard?」
PERRIER:「I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are ether hiding, or passing for Gentile. The S.S.Colonel smiles.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better himself.」
PERRIER:「But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me. The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews, and found nothing.」

Colonel Hans Landa:「I'm aware of that, I read the report on this area. But like any enterprise, when under new management, there's always a slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless. I just have A few questions Monsieur LaPadite, if you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family. Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and referring to it;
 Now before the occupation there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself. The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins, and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?」

narrator:
PERRIER:「To my knowledge those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers. - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe? Looking up from his papers.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house, make yourself comfortable. The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi guest. As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel studies the papers in front of him.
 Now according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis. Somewhere in the last year it would appear they have vanished. Which leads me to the conclusion that they've ether made good their escape, or someone is very successfully hiding them. (looking up from his papers, across the table at The」
narrator:FARMER) What have you heard about The Dreyfusis Monsieur LaPadite?
PERRIER:「Only rumors -」

Colonel Hans Landa:「I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where rumors, true or false are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding The Dreyfusis? The Farmerlooks at Landa.」

narrator:I.
Colonel Hans Landa:「Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want to hear what the rumors are, not who told them to you. The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.」
PERRIER:「Again, this is just a rumor - but we heard the Dreyfusis had made there way into Spain.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「So the rumors you've heard have been of escape?」
PERRIER:「Yes.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis friendly? As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the floorboards revealing;」
narrator:FIVE HUMAN BEINGS lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards. These human beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the dairy farmers house for the past year. But one couldn't call what The Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to exterminate them.

PERRIER:「We were families in the same community, in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say we were friends, but members of the same community, we had common interest. The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves to the next question.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Having never met the Dreyfusis, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?」

narrator:
PERRIER:「There were five of them. The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram... her brother, Bob ...」
Colonel Hans Landa:「How old is Bob?」

Colonel Hans Landa:「Well I guess that should do it. Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his ttache case. the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.
 However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?」

narrator:it.
PERRIER:「But of course. Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the aft of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass, German Officer talks.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?」
PERRIER:「I have no interest in such things.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「But you are aware of what they call me?」
PERRIER:「I'm aware.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「What are you aware of?」
PERRIER:「That they call you, "The Jew Hunter".」

Colonel Hans Landa:「Precisely! Now I understand your trepidation in repeating it. Before he was assassinated, Heydrich apparently hated the moniker the good people of Prague bestowed on him. Actually why he would hate the name, "The Hangman", is baffling to me It would appear he did everything in his power to earn it. But I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title, precisely because I've earned it. As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize with the french farmer.
 The feature that makes me such a effective hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most German soldiers, I can think like a jew. where they can only think like a German, or more precisely, a German soldier. Now if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and predatory instinct of a hawk.」

narrator:COL LANDA
  Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips - smell - physical strength - penis size. But, if one were to determine what attributes the jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat. Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda have said pretty much the same thing. Where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison a insult. Consider for a moment, the world a rat lives in. It's a hostile world indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your front door right now, would you greet it with hostility?
PERRIER:「I suppose I would.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?」
PERRIER:「Rat's spread disease, they bite people -」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Unless some fool is stupid enough to try and handle a live one, rats don't make it a practise of biting human beings. Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever caused you to be sick a day in your life? I purpose to you, any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry. Yet I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?」

PERRIER:「No.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Yet, they are both rodent's, are they not? And except for the fact that one has a big bushy tail, while the other has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin, they even rather look alike, don't they?」

narrator:
PERRIER:「It is a interesting thought, beer Colonel.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「However, interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper through your door, this very minute, would you offer it a saucer of your delicious milk?」
PERRIER:「Probably not.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「I didn't think so. You don't like them. You don't really know why you don't like them. All you know is, you find them repulsive. (let's the」

A the Nazi Colonel, busies himself with his smoking life, he ontinues to hold court at the Frenchmans table.
Colonel Hans Landa:「The other mistake the German soldier make is their severe handling of the citizens who give shelter and aid to the Jews. These citizens are not enemies of the state. They are simply confused people, trying to make some sense out of the madness war creates. These citizens do not need punishing. They simply need to be reminded of their duty in war time. Let's use you as a example Monsieur LaPadite. In this war, you have found yourself in the middle of a conflict that has nothing to do with yourself, your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet, here you are. So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose a question. In this time of war, what is your number one duty? Is it to fight the Germans in the name of France to your last breath? Or, is it to harass the occupying army to the best of your ability? Or, is it to protect the poor unfortunate victims of warfare who can not protect themselfs? Or, is your number one duty in this time of bloodshed, to protect those very beautiful women who constitute your family? The Colonel lets the last statement stand.
 That was a question Monsieur LaPadite. In this time of war, What do you consider your number one duty?」

PERRIER:「To protect my family.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Now, my job dictates, that I must have my men enter your home, and conduct a thorough search, before I can officially cross your families name off my list.」

narrator:COL LANDA
  And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured, they will be. That is unless, you have something to tell me that will make the conducting of a search unnecessary.
 PAUSE) I might add also, that any information that makes the preforming of My duty easier, will not be met with punishment. Actually quite the contrary, it will be met with reward. And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in anyway, by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country. The Farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German opponent.
Colonel Hans Landa:「You are sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?」
PERRIER:「Yes.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Your sheltering them underneath your floorboards aren't you?」
PERRIER:「Yes.」
Colonel Hans Landa:「Point out to me the area's where their hiding. The Farmer points out the area's on the floor with the Dreyfusis are underneath.
 Since I haven't heard any disturbance, I assume that while their listening, they don't speak english?」

And after word spreads about what happened today, it's highly unlikely she will find any willing farmers to extend her aid. If I had to guess her fate, I'd say she'll probably be turned in by some neighbour. Or, she'll be spotted by some German soldier. Or, we'll find her body in the woods, dead from starvation or exposure. Or, perhaps-she'll survive. She will elude capture. She will escape to America. She will move to New York city.
