Jigsaw:「on tape) Rise and shine, Adam. Youre probably wondering where you are. Ill tell you where you might be. You might be in the room that you die in. Up until now, you simply sat in the shadows, watching others live out their lives. But what do voyeurs see when they look into the mirror? Now, I see you as a strange mix of someone angry and yet apathetic. But mostly just pathetic. So are you going to watch yourself die today, Adam? Or do something about it? (end)」

Jigsaw:「on tape) Dr. Gordon, this is your wake up call. Every day of your working life, you have given people the news that they are going to die soon. Now you will be the cause of death. Your aim in this game is to kill Adam. (Adam glances down at the tape recorder wide-eyed, then back up at Lawrence) You have until six on the clock to do it. There sa man in the room with you. When theres that much poison in your blood (another view of the body from Lawrences POV), the only thing left to do is shoot yourself. (Jigsaw coughs) There are ways to win this hidden all around you. Just remember: X marks the spot for the treasure. If you do not kill Adam by 6:00, then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you in this room to rot. Let the game begin. (end)」
narrator:The looks on each mans face clearly say Oh Shit. The tape ends. Lawrence stands up.
LAWRENCE:「firmly) Give me that. Now. (Adam tosses him the tape. He catches it, rewinds, plays back. Adam stands up from his spot on the floor.)」

Jigsaw:「on tape)...then Alison and Diana will die, Dr. Gordon. And Ill leave you in this room to rot.」
ADAM:「thinking, trying to figure this out) Any idea who that is?」
Jigsaw:「on tape) Let the game begin.」
ADAM:「He knows us.」
LAWRENCE:「Wait a minute. (rewinds more)」
ADAM:「false hope) What do you think? Probably a joke, right?」
LAWRENCE:「Shh, shh! (presses play)」
Jigsaw:「on tape) Let the game begin.」
LAWRENCE:「softly) Listen...」
Jigsaw:「on tape, in a VERY hushed tone after a brief silence)...Follow your heart.」

Jigsaw:「on tape) Hello Paul. You are a perfectly healthy, sane, middle-class male. Yet last month, you ran a straight razor across your wrists. Did you cut yourself because you truly wanted to die, or did you just want some attention? Tonight, youll show me. The irony is that if you want to die, you just have to stay where you are. But if you want to live, youll have to cut yourself again. (Flashback shot of Paul waking up in the cage, looking around, scared and confused. The shots go back and forth between the detectives and the Paul flashback, with him grabbing and shaking the razor wire, screaming. His screams sound distant under Jigsaws voice.) Find the path through the razor wire to the door. But hurry. At 3:00 that door will lock and then this room becomes your tomb. How much blood will you shed to stay alive, Paul? (end)」
narrator:KERRY (stopping the tape) The door was on a timer. It was unlocked until 3:00. Then it slammed shut. He was given two hours.
 Cut back to Detective Tapp, who notices something and shines his light on it. We see a strange wound on Pauls body, a piece of flesh carved out into the shape of a jigsaw piece.

TAPP:「Jigsaw piece. (Sing looks in as well, see it. There is a quick flash of crime scene photos showing a close up of the wound. Tapp sighs.) I think were gonna be here for a while, Sing. (Sing looks to him. We get another quick crime scene shot of Paul.)」
LAWRENCE:「VO) The newspapers started calling him the Jigsaw Killer.」
narrator:Cut back to Lawrence in the bathroom. For his next two spoken lines, the shot switches back and forth between him and the detectives in the razor wire room.
LAWRENCE:「Actually, technically speaking, hes not really a murderer. He never killed anyone.」
narrator:Sing, wearing gloves, gets in the cage and examines Pauls body a bit. A flash of another crime scene photo of the wound with a ruler held up to it is shown. More gruesome crime scene photos of that and other wounds are flashed across the screen.
LAWRENCE:「VO) He finds ways for his victims to kill themselves.」
narrator:Cut to Sing kneeled down over a charred corpse, completely blackened, at another crime scene. We hear Jigsaws voice from a tape recorder play over the scene as the detectives look around, and over the flashback shots.
Jigsaw:「VO, on tape) Hello Mark. If youre so sick, then why do I have so many photos of you up and about? (there is a quick montage of a camera snapping several black and white shots of Mark up and about, looking around and getting into a car.) Lets put your so-called illness to the test. (Flashback image of Mark waking up. He is a younger man in his mid to late twenties, with dark brown hair. He is completely nude, smeared in some kind of Vaseline-like ointment. In front of him is a small, square glass plate held up by some chains. On the plate is a micro cassette player, a lit votive candle, and a box of matches. He gets up, looking around confusedly and scared.) Right now, there is a slow-acting poison in your veins. The antidote is in the safe. (Black and white crime scene shot of the safe, then a shot of Mark standing over it, screaming, his screams distant under Jigsaws voice, as with Paul.) The combination to the safe (quick montage of several black and white crime-scene photos of numbers written all over the walls) is written on the wall. Hurry up and program it in. But watch your step (Marks bare foot steps on the broken glass scattered all across the floor). And by the way, thats a flammable substance smeared on your body (shot of Mark looking at the ointment on his hand, up his arm, everywhere), so I would be careful with that candle, if I were you...」

Jigsaw:「VO ctd)....or all the people youve burned with your act (Mark starts to turn the lock on the safe) just might have their revenge.」

Jigsaw:「from the TV) Hello Amanda. You dont know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Heres what happens if you lose. (The video moves next to the doll, to a device like the one shes wearing attached to a mannequin head. As he continues, explaining what it is, her breathing grows faster and heavier, and her moans pick up more.) The device youre wearing is hooked into your upper and lower jaws. When the timer at the back goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open. Think of it like a reverse bear trap. Here, Ill show you.」
narrator:The video pans back to a view of the doll and the device. The dolls head moves and looks down at the device, and the camera zooms in on it. A timer ticks away. A few seconds later, SNAP! The device springs and the fake head is crushed and explodes. Amanda shrieks, her eyes widening. The video switches back to a close up of the doll.
Jigsaw:「from the TV) There is only one key to open the device. Its in the stomach of your dead cellmate. Look around, Amanda. Know that Im not lying. You better hurry up. Live or die. Make your choice.」

narrator:Cut back to the cell, her bloody hands sifting through intestines for a key. Cut back to interrogation room Amanda, then cut back again to her holding up a liver or some other organ. Back to interrogation room Amanda, the horror on her face growing, then back to the cell.
 Amanda s hand pulls a small key from inside the organ shes holding. She reaches around the back of her head, quickly trying to unlock the padlock. The timer ticks away, faster and faster. She gets it, pulls off the padlock and opens the device in the back, ripping it away from her head and throwing it down as it snaps open. She lets out the most terrible, agonized, heart-wrenching scream, sobbing loudly, her hands held out in front of her, rocking back and forth.
 Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing the puppet from the video in the corner. Amanda sees it, staring at it wide eyed, her sobs softening for a moment as she stares at it. Slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle. She can only stare and cry, not sure what to do or expect. It stops, leering at her, then speaks.
Jigsaw:「Congratulations. You are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore.」

DIANA:「Youre not going to leave us, are you, Daddy?」
LAWRENCE:「suddenly concerned) What? (He stops at the door, turns, goes back over to her bed, sits down next to her and leans over. This was the last thing hed expected her to say) What are you talking about? You mean, leave you and Mommy? (She nods; he reaches up and gently brushes her hair away from her face.) No, no sweetheart, I would never do that. Who gave you that idea?」
DIANA:「No one.」
LAWRENCE:「Well its not true, okay?」
DIANA:「very softly) Okay.」
LAWRENCE:「How much do I love you?」
narrator:He moves his face closer to her and together they say
 LAWRENCE &amp; DIANA Love you very much
LAWRENCE:「Thats right, thats right! (He gives her a kiss, pulls back.) Good night, sweetie.」
DIANA:「Good night, Daddy.」
narrator:Lawrence gets up and goes to the door, flipping the lights off. He pauses before he steps out.
LAWRENCE:「Tomorrow, Ill read you your favourite story.」
DIANA:「with a small smile) Okay.」
LAWRENCE:「Okay. (he goes out.)」
narrator:Quick cut to the Entrance Hall of the Gordon Residence. Lawrence walks towards the door, Alison behind him. Alisons voice starts to cut over the scene. Her tone is very pissed off.
ALISON:「I dont know how much longer I can do this, Larry.」
LAWRENCE:「sounds as though he has no idea what she means) What, what are you talking about?」
ALISON:「pissed, in disbelief) How can you walk through life pretending that youre happy?」
LAWRENCE:「I am happy.」
ALISON:「confrontational) That is complete bullshit. (cut to a shot of Diana, laying on her side in her darkened room, clutching her teddy bear to her chest. Her eyes are open, she can hear everything. We stay with her for the rest of Alisons line, her voice now off a bit in the distance but still very audible) Id rather you break down and tell me that you hated me. At least thered be some passion in it.」
LAWRENCE:「Would you like to see her? (He reaches into his pocket and takes out his wallet, throws it across the room to Adam, who is sitting with his back against the wall, facing Lawrence. Adam picks up the wallet and opens it. He sees two pictures of Diana, side by side. The one on the left is Diana hugging a dog. The one on the right is a smiling portrait outside somewhere.」
ADAM:「Shes beautiful.」
LAWRENCE:「Thank you.」
ADAM:「sighs, then looks up at Lawrence) You gonna have any more kids?」

LAWRENCE:「a bit wearily, but not snobby) Weve talked about it, but uh, with our schedules, its difficult enough to concentrate on one. (The tone of his voice indicates that maybe hes starting to realize that he shouldve spent more time and attention to his daughter.)」
ADAM:「referring to the wallet) So wheres the lucky wife? (a small smile)」
LAWRENCE:「Theres another picture behind the one youre looking at. (Adam reaches behind the photo on the right and pulls another photograph out. Lawrence smiles slightly as he speaks) Its my favourite one because were all in it together. Someone, usually me, has to hold the camera, which means Im always missing from the photos.」
narrator:Cut to Adam, looking at the picture he pulled out. His face is blank, but you can sense great disturbance behind it. Cut to a shot of the photo he is holding. It is not the one Lawrence described, but a Polaroid of Alison and Diana bound and gagged, and the message Regards with a jigsaw piece drawn next to it. He turns the photo over, and there is a message. As he reads it, Jigsaw reads it aloud in a voiceover.
Jigsaw:「VO) X Marks the spot. Sometimes you see more with your eyes shut.」

TAPP:「nods very slightly) You know, we arrested a dentist last week who like to play with kids a bit too much. He lived two blocks from here. The sewer lines run under this neighborhood too, Doctor. (hint hint)」
narrator:Lawrence stands straight up, walks away. Tapp waits a moment, then drives off.
 BAM into static and then the video from Amandas cell. We are not at Tapps desk in the police station, watching him obsessively watch the video, staring at the screen, remote control in hand. As he watches, the camera circles around behind the television to give us a better view of our obsessed detective.
Jigsaw:「from the video) Hello Amanda. You dont know me, but I know you. I want to play a game. Heres what happens if you lose. Theres a timer at the back of the device youre wearing. When the timer goes off, your mouth will be permanently ripped open.」

Jigsaw:「from video) Think of it like a reverse bear trap.」
narrator:Tapp fast forwards a bit, hits play.
Jigsaw:「from video) Ill show you...」

Jigsaw:「on video) There is only one key...」

SING:「Ill leave you to have fun up here. (He puts his hands on his hips, watching some more of the video.)」
Jigsaw:「on video) Its in the stomach of your dead cellmate.」

narrator:Sing chuckles, hits Tapp playfully on the arm, tapp laughs a bit too, but doesnt look up. Sing remains grinning a bit. But then Tapp continues and rewinds the video a bit.
Jigsaw:「on video) Its in the stomach of your dead cellmate.」
narrator:Tapp fast forwards.
Jigsaw:「on video) Look around, Amanda. Know that Im not lying. (Sing steps off to the right) You better hurry up. (Tapp rewinds again, suddenly pauses)」

Jigsaw:「Awake already, Jeff? I need more powerful tranquilizers next time. (Jeff continues his cries, sheds a few tears. Jigsaw reaches over and touches his shoulder) Dont cry. Ive given your life a purpose. Youre a test subject for something greater than yourself.」

narrator:Jigsaw slowly raises his hands, starts to turn to face them but then quickly steps down hard on a red button on the floor, and the drill trap on Jeffs chair comes to life. He remains with his back mostly to them, hands still raised.
Jigsaw:「Now youll make a choice. (Sing runs up the steps to try to where Jigsaw is, gun aimed at him. Tapp remains where he stands.) In 20 seconds, the life of this man will be ended.」

TAPP:「Tell him how to stop it!」
narrator:Jigsaw backs up a bit towards the stairs.
Jigsaw:「One key will unlock it.」
SING:「frantic) Where is it?!」
Jigsaw:「Its in the box.」
SING:「Box! (He sees a box on the side of the chair and opens it. Inside he pulls out a ring of at least 30 keys, and goes over to behind Jeff to try to unlock the device. He tries a couple of keys, none working.) Fuck! Which key, which key?!」
TAPP:「Tell him which key it is!」
Jigsaw:「now facing Tapp, moving closer to him. His back is to us, we still dont see his face.) Time is running out.」
TAPP:「Shut up and get down here right now, asshole!」
narrator:Jigsaw slowly moves down towards him more.
Jigsaw:「Whats more important to you Officer, arresting me or the life of another human being?」
narrator:Sing keeps trying various keys. Tapp goes up Jigsaw and grabs him, pushing him down to his knees. Jigsaw keeps his arms slightly raised.
TAPP:「Get down on your knees!」
SING:「Jesus! Tapp! Tapp!」

TAPP:「gun aimed at the back of Jigsaws head) Hands behind your head! (Jigsaw obliges) Sick bastard.」
Jigsaw:「Yes, I am sick, Officer.」
SING:「still trying various keys, none working. Hes in a full-fledged panic. Jeff closes his eyes, crying, as the drills are only 2 inches away) Tapp! Its like, theres a hundred keys in here!」
Jigsaw:「Sick from the disease eating away at me inside. Sick of people who dont appreciate their blessings. Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others.」
narrator:Sing finally whips out his gun and shoots each drill, breaking and stopping them. Tapp glances up at him, briefly distracted by the gunfire.
Jigsaw:「as he pops a blade out of a wristband hidden up his right sleeve) Sick of it all! (He lashes upwards, slashing Tapps throat)」

ADAM:「pause, then) Yes, Im willing to risk it! Give me that sweet cancer. (Lawrence ignores his request, tosses out the other cigarette and a lighter. He finds lastly a small folded up note with the words Shh, Doctor, written on it.) I dont care, I really dont. Give me one of those.」
narrator:Jigsaws voiceover reads whats written on the note as Lawrence opens the paper and reads it, keeping it low in the box where Adam cant see it.
Jigsaw:「VO) The cigarettes are harmless, I promise. Smoking is only poisonous when it ends in bloodshed. Think about this - you dont need a gun to kill Adam.」

Jigsaw:「VO) Think about this...you dont need a gun to kill Adam. When theres that much poison in your blood (a slow shot moving to the pool of blood from the body in front of Lawrence), the only thing left to do is shoot yourself.」

ADAM:「thinking) Key...key...」
narrator:He starts going through Zeps pockets, patting him down. He finds Zeps wallet, opens it and feels through it; there s nothing of value to him right now. He tosses it down. He continues feeling for something, suddenly feels something in Zerps coat pocket. His eyes widen as he reaches in, wincing from the pain in his shoulder. He pulls out a tape recorder. He stares at it, his eyes and mouth starting to widen. He glances down at Zep, then at the tape recorder. Sitting up a bit more, he presses play. It is Jigsaws voice.
Jigsaw:「VO) Hello Mr. Hindle. Or as they called you around the hospital: (shot of Zep in the hospital with his cleaning cart, stopping at Johns room) Zep. I want you to make a choice. (Shot of the closet doors in Dianas room flying open, Diana screaming, Alison coming in and seeing him looming over her. Shot of him tying and gagging Alison and Diana. Shot of the photo of Diana and Alison tied and gagged.) Theres a slow-acting poison coursing through your system (shot of Zep watching the monitor, holding his hand to his mouth. He actually looks rather ill) which only I have the antidote for. Will you murder and mother and her child (Zep rocking aback and forth, getting ready to kill Alison and Diana) to save yourself? (Shot of Zep next to Alison, saying Dr. Gordons time is up; holds the phone to her ear. Shot of Zep in the living room, screaming Mrs. Gordon! Shot of Zep on the floor firing up at Tapp.) Listen carefully, if you will. There are rules. (Lawrence on the floor looking up at Zep, asks Why? to which Zep says Its the rules.)」
