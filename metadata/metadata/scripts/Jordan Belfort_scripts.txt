narrator:Jordan can't respond. Phone still to his ear, his eyelids droop. Drool spills from his slackened jaw.

Jordan Belfort:「V.O.) After fifteen years in storage, the Lemmons had developed a delayed fuse.」
narrator:JORDAN'S POV -- is hazy as he stares at his own reflection in the pay phone.
Jordan Belfort:「V.O.) It took 90 minutes for the little fuckers to kick in, but once they did -- pow! I had skipped the tingle phase and went straight to the drool phase.」
narrator:JORDAN'S POV -- the phone gets further and further away.
Jordan Belfort:「V.O.) Actually I'd discovered a new phase: the cerebral palsy phase.」
narrator:BAMMM!! Jordan hits the floor with a thud, crashed out on his back. From the dangling phone, we hear:
BO DIETL:「O.S.) (over phone) Jordan! Jordan! Do not get behind the wheel! Just tell me where you're at, I'll send Rocco!」
narrator:Jordan lolls his head toward the phone, tries to reach for it; he can't. He lays there for a while, then:
Jordan Belfort:「V.O.) C'mon, stand up!」
narrator:He rolls onto all fours, lifts a hand, topples over.

Jordan Belfort:「V.O.) Okay, walking is off the list of options. All right, what else is there? (a brainstorm) I can crawl, like Skylar!」
narrator:Slowly, Jordan begins crawling like an infant to the top of the staircase.
