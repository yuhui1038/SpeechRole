Because there are still witches here among us !
 [ Gasping , murmuring ]
 Perhaps in this very hall ! Imagine a foe you ca n't see armed with weapons unknown and the ability to appear as any one of us !

George:「[ Grunting ]」
Cotton:「They do . But they have deeded them to the devil himself in exchange for powers and all that they desire .」

Mr. Hale:「I find I worry more about the French and the Indian attacks than I do witches . What 's your opinion , Captain Alden ? Just how vulnerable are we ?」

We may someday over - people this vast , empty new land , but I fear that we have already over - peopled hell . So that , as it is written in Isaiah , " hell hath enlarged herself . " And is now called ... America . I have been in Salem a fortnight , and I have already hung three witches . Is this the price of building heaven on earth ? I have laid my hands upon his most deadly servants ... The witches . Or have I ? I obeyed every one of your instructions . I even pressed a possibly innocent man to death . I still taste his spattered blood on my lips . Please , lord , I beg thee . Give me a sign .」

narration:I 've been expecting the angel of death since I was 10 . I did n't see him myself , but I knew from the look in grandfather 's eyes just before he went , the angel bore a most terrible face . Quite like yours , I expect . So come , angel . You find me fully prepared to burn like a human candle for eternity in a pit of burning black tar with all the other damned .
John:「Burning black tar ? I thought hell was fire .」

Cotton:「A common misconception . Hellfire burns like fire but is the consistency of thick black pitch . What ? What have you seen ?」

Mary Sibley:「If he 's a problem , he 's my problem .」
Mr. Hale:「With all due respect , he could become a problem for us all .」
Mary Sibley:「My husband controls Salem , and I control him . You do nothing without my say . With all due respect .」
Mr. Hale:「Yes , ma'am .」
Mary Sibley:「Concern yourself with one thing , Mr. Hale ... Find out who broke our circle . Head back to the woods . Find the seer . His eyes were there .」
Isaac:「It was right here we saw the witches .」
Cotton:「Captain Alden saw all this , too ?」
Isaac:「Yeah . And something else ... Something I ai n't seen before . They stabbed a bird ... A white dove . I killed more than a few pigeons myself , and a dove ai n't nothing but a prettier pigeon , but this felt different . I ca n't say why ... Like it was the saddest thing in the world ... To bleed a dove to death . Just the one dove .」

Bridget:「We should not be praying for God to do what we can accomplish ourselves . Mercy Lewis is not suffering the work of witches or demons , but some natural malady or fever of the mind , yet she hangs here like an animal .」
Mary Sibley:「She broke her ropes three times at home , not to mention her father 's arm . She bit off her own finger and tears at her flesh .」
Mercy:「[ Groans ]」
Mary Sibley:「Mercy must be protected from herself and we from her . There 's no better place to do both than in the house of God .」

Bridget:「I think the selectmen are exploiting her condition to create fear in Salem . This so - called " witch panic " is yet another attempt by the puritans to control us .」
Mary Sibley:「Miss Bishop , please ... Be careful of the words that you speak . To less sympathetic ears , they could sound like the words of the devil himself .」
Bridget:「I 'm ... sorry if my words were harsh . Sometimes , my tongue runs ahead of my mind .」

Mary Sibley:「I know well my duties . Attend to your own .」
Tituba:「Your duties and seeing that you fulfill them is my duty , like it or not .」

Mary Sibley:「I 've made my choice . But we need more than another victim ... We need a sign . And I know just the person to deliver us both . Our Cotton Mather is quite obsessed with signs ... Wrote chapter and verse on them . But there is one sign they dread more than any other . The sign of a monstrous birth .」
Tituba:「You would do such a thing ?」
Mary Sibley:「No , I have no need to pluck a single leaf from the tree of life when a leaf is already dead on the branch . There 's a girl out there who carries death inside . I could smell the baby , floating dead and malformed in her mother 's womb . Do n't weep for her . She never tasted a single bitter breath of life 's betrayals . Yet her brief flicker of life will burn like a comet over earth when I make of her a sign ... Of the doom that 's come upon Salem . Do you know what I enjoy most , George ? Turning the good souls of Salem against one another , like the rabid dogs you trained them to be .」

Cotton:「No Latin , Captain ? Oh , of course not . You 've no time for books .」

Isaac:「Stop it .」
narration:You fight each other . Who fights them ?
Cotton:「He has a point .」
John:「So , where do we begin ?」
Cotton:「Inside the tree , I found what fuels their work ... Like the wood of a fire . See , everything the witch does is powered by two things ... Lust and death . The lust they provide for themselves , but they must look elsewhere for the dead parts . The town would be aware if their own Salem burial ground was being disturbed by corpse grinding .」
John:「So where do they get them ?」
Cotton:「Isaac , if you 'd be so kind as to explain to the captain your duties .」
Isaac:「I got all kind of duties ... Packages to deliver . I also deliver the unwanteds to the crags .」
John:「The unwanteds ?」
Isaac:「You know , Indians , slaves , criminals ... Pretty much anybody ai n't fit to be laid in Salem ground .」
Cotton:「This is where the witches harvest . And at the risk of another thrashing , it is also your best hope of reclaiming your friend 's remains .」
John:「You dumped his body into the crags ? ! Giles Corey built half this town , and you threw him into a goddamn ditch ? ! Let 's go .」
Cotton:「Where ?」
John:「To get Giles out of that shithole .」
Mary Sibley:「All of Salem is diminished by your loss . I can only imagine your suffering .」

Kitty:「Thank you , Mrs. Sibley .」
Mary Sibley:「The others said that you were frightened ... You thought that someone was trying to hurt your baby ? Tell me what happened . Tell me . I 'm going to tell you something . I 've never told anyone before . I , too , have lost a child . Oh , I know the pain you feel . I feel it even now . You must tell me what happened so that your child did not die in vain . I promise you ... No harm will come to you . Tell me .」

Mr. Hale:「It is n't a matter of what I think .」

John:「Another rush to judgment , Mather ?」

Cotton:「Quite the contrary , I fear . It is judgment that is rushing towards all of us . Behold the warrant of judgment . For our sins , individual and collective , he has signed the seal of Satan , a message straight from hell to herald the arrival of the devil in Salem . And who delivered his message for him ? Bridget Bishop . Did you or did you not deliver this monster from that girl ?」
Bridget:「Yes , but ...」
Cotton:「Did you or did you not minister to this girl while she carried it ?」
Bridget:「Yes , sir , but I minister ...」
Cotton:「Did you or did you not frequently dose her with physics and potions and herbal concoctions of your own devising ?」
Bridget:「Sir , that is what I do , but I did not ...」
Cotton:「And did you or did you not place your hands upon her belly , pressing this way and that just before the thing came out ?」
Bridget:「I was turning the babe so ...」
Cotton:「Aye , but turning it into what ?」
Anne:「Stop !」
narration:[ Audience murmuring ]
 Whatever that poor stone child may be , you are the true monster !
Mr. Hale:「I apologize for my daughter . The accused is a dear friend of hers . But I share her concern . You would accuse a woman ... A woman whom we all know and trust , who never did anything but help other women to deliver their babies and care for those who no one wanted ? And now , suddenly , we 're to believe she 's a witch ?」
Cotton:「The devil is patient . And so are his servants ... Our friends , our neighbors ... Till , finally , they are called to serve him . Bridget Bishop , you have delivered a monster into the world . You were seen in your true guise , the night hag , by your victim . And even those who were duped by your innocent image could still sense the palpable stench of evil around them as you destroyed a babe in the cradle of life ... A sign of your master 's declaration of war upon us . How do you plead ?」
Bridget:「I did no such thing . I 'm innocent ! Oh , you must believe me ... I am ...」
John:「I 'm a little confused , Mather . Did Bridget make that sign ... Or did God ? No . No , no , no . Wait . I remember . God told the devil , and the devil made her do it ... Have I got this right ? No ? Maybe I 'm just not as smart as you . I have n't read all those books , but I have seen a few things in the world . And in this world , bad things happen , generally with no more meaning than the roll of a dice .」
Cotton:「This monstrosity ... It 's just an unlucky roll of God 's dice ?」
John:「Probably the unluckiest I 've seen .」
Cotton:「Well , then , we have a most profound difference of opinion .」
John:「We do . But you would hang a woman on your opinion .」

Cotton:「And on yours , you would let an agent of the devil himself walk free to do more malice .」
John:「Then put her on trial , too . Do n't just stop there . There were others with her . Or maybe they 're all responsible .」
Gloriana:「No , you ca n't ! It 's not my fault !」
John:「It 's not your fault ?」
narration:No , I think that you 're probably right . I think ... and I know this is unthinkable to you , Mather ... But maybe , just maybe , it 's no one 's fault .
 [ Audience murmuring ]
 We all know that killing is different . Killing is always someone 's fault . The stones are n't dry from the blood of Giles Corey , and now you are willing to hang a woman ... This woman , Bridget Bishop ... And , hell , throw in a few whores for good measure ... And for what ?
 [ Audience murmuring ]
Mary Sibley:「Perhaps it 's time we heard from Mercy .」
narration:Is n't that right , reverend Mather ? Is n't she bound to react in front of the guilty witch or witches ?
Cotton:「My father and all the experts agree ...」
Mary Sibley:「Then take them to her .」

John:「I do n't think I 've ever seen such a mixture of reason and bullshit in a man .」
Cotton:「If you only knew what I know ...」

Mr. Hale:「Yes , and we shall all burn together at this rate . You 're too young to understand the risk you 're taking . I saw my entire family burned at the stake . I tasted their ashes in my mouth . I have no desire to taste my own ... Or my daughter 's .」
Anne:「[ Crying ]」
Mary Sibley:「Well , perhaps you old - world witches are simply too scared or too scarred ... To claim this new world . Not me .」

Mr. Hale:「I 'm not alone . The elders have their doubts , too .」

Mary Sibley:「Then perhaps he should make one .」
Mr. Hale:「Trials are preceded by accusations .」
narration:And accusations are predicated upon your control of the girl .
Rose:「The hunter 's moon fast approaches .」
Mr. Hale:「Yet the blacksmith still blithely peddles his wares , his blood lost to our cause .」

Tituba:「How dare you . Before Mary , we were not feared , but fearful , not hunters , but prey . And yet does her strength and vision garner your praise ? No . Only your doubt .」
Mary Sibley:「The girl has been rendered frail by her circumstance . Nothing more . My mastery is not of issue .」
Rose:「This is an assurance ?」
Mary Sibley:「She needs but a moment of rest . After which , she will again be strong enough to point the finger .」
Mr. Hale:「Yet another issue remains ... that of John Alden .」
Mary Sibley:「What of him ?」
Mr. Hale:「His suspicion of me is palpable . If she can not abate his threat , then I will be forced to do so myself ... as I see fit .」
Rose:「Should you desire John Alden 's trust , I would suggest you find a way to earn it . And , Mary ... Your vision guides us . I will report to the others that your plan shall resume anon .」
Tituba:「We need answers quickly .」
Mary Sibley:「And we will get them .」
Tituba:「How ?」
Mary Sibley:「The quickest way one finds answers ... blame . Is it your intent to rob me of my remaining faith in you , Reverend ?」

Cotton:「Mrs. Sibley . I did n't hear you arrive .」
Mary Sibley:「Your charge , simple and clear , is to protect the Lewis girl from further possession . And yet ... Was the episode in the marketplace not evidence of exactly that ?」
Cotton:「We have no proof it was the work of witches .」
Mary Sibley:「So you 've paid her a visit , then ? You 've determined what ails her ?」
Cotton:「The pastor says she 's resting and best not be disturbed .」
Mary Sibley:「May I ask you a question , Reverend ? When your father seeks out demons , does he ask permission ? Does he knock on doors and offer to come back at a more convenient time ? Or does he , armed with the lord 's righteousness , demand the demon answer to him ?」
Cotton:「My father and I are different men . We work in different ways .」
Mary Sibley:「When I summoned a hunter of witches to protect the people of Salem , it was not you I requested . Yet it was you who arrived on our shores . Do not make me regret settling for my second choice .」

Mr. Hale:「Captain Alden . How fortuitous . I was just about to set this on your doorstep . I 'll spare you the mystery . It 's a reception tomorrow evening in your honor .」
John:「A reception ? No . That 's not necessary .」
Mr. Hale:「But it is . You 're a selectman now .」
narration:And , on a more personal note , a chance to make amends for my less - than - hospitable behavior since your return . Can we trust you 'll be in attendance ?
John:「Excuse me , magistrate . Lieutenant Hooke .」
William:「John Alden . Now , is this any way to greet the man who saved you from those savages ?」
John:「What the hell are you doing here ?」
William:「Business , Captain . There is a vessel in port on which I have cargo . And until the quarantine is lifted , I am marooned here in your little witch town .」
John:「We had a deal , and it was a simple one ... that I was never to set eyes on you again .」
William:「Yes . Well , you need n't worry . We 're not the same men we were in the war . But ... There is something you could do to hasten my departure .」
John:「What is that ?」
William:「The girl you spoke of in battle ... Mary Walcott . Although she 's Mary Sibley now , is n't she ? An introduction with her would certain ...」
John:「You stay away from Mary .」
William:「Or what , John ? What will you do ?」
John:「What I should have done last time .」
William:「[ Scoffs ] Now , careful , Captain . Before a man makes threats , he should take stock of what he risks ... unless you do not mind me telling the good people of Salem just who John Alden really is ... neither the man nor the war hero he purports to be .」
John:「I want you to finish your business with all due haste , and then by coach or by steed or by ship , I want you gone . You have my word .」
Mary Sibley:「Mr. Sibley 's feeding will have to wait until I return from the reception .」

Mary Sibley:「As you 've doubtless heard , it 's under quarantine .」
William:「Well , ' tis no bother . I merely mean to board the vessel and retrieve my cargo .」
Mary Sibley:「And risk infection ? Or worse ? Well , this must be very valuable cargo , Mr. Hooke . Sorry . No one 's permitted on board .」
William:「Well , perhaps Mr. Sibley will be more open to reason .」
Mary Sibley:「I can assure you , Mr. Hooke , my husband and I are of one mind on all matters . Good evening .」
Cotton:「Mercy , if you can hear me , I beseech you , speak to me the name of the vengeful spirit that possesses you .」
Reverend Lewis:「Has n't she suffered enough ?」
Cotton:「Which is why I seek to end her suffering ... by freeing her from the demon inside .」

Reverend Lewis:「Mm .」

Mary Sibley:「Valerian root ? You 've resorted to the coarse tools of the hunters .」

Mr. Hale:「Yes . Well , sadly , I can no longer take the safety of my loved ones for granted . Apparently , there are those in Salem who are not above threatening the lives of children .」
Mary Sibley:「Hm . She 's no child , magistrate . Certainly not , judging by the way she lusts for John Alden .」
Cotton:「Mrs. Sibley . I came straightaway with news . Mercy Lewis is free of her possessor .」
Mary Sibley:「You 're certain ?」
Cotton:「My exam was thorough . I could glean no remaining evidence of the demon inside .」
Mary Sibley:「How serendipitous .」
Cotton:「Perhaps beyond good fortune .」
narration:This is evidence of the witches ' waning strength or waxing fear ... a testament to the potency of our resistance .
Mary Sibley:「Forgive me , uh , Reverend , as I am but a layman in these matters , but how did she free herself from Satan 's grasp ?」
Cotton:「I detected traces of agrimony , as well as an incision in the girl 's abdomen , leading to my supposition that an exorcism had been performed .」

Mary Sibley:「An exorcism ? A catholic ritual performed in Salem , and you have the audacity to present this as good news ? Do you know what Salem abhors even more than a witch , Reverend ? A catholic . Yet under your most watchful eye ,」
narration:you 've now allowed both to flourish .
 When could this have happened , Reverend ... when you were distracted by drink or by whores ?
Cotton:「Mrs. Sibley ...」
Mary Sibley:「Replacing demons with heathens is no victory . Seems even when you succeed , Reverend , you find a way to fail .」
Mr. Hale:「We live in a time of war , our enemies hidden among us . And so there could be no better time than this to welcome a new ally in our fight against the dark forces that threaten our town . Witches will be no match for a war hero . The newest member of our board of selectmen ... Captain John Alden .」
John:「What if the witches were not the common folk ? Not those who trapped our food nor birthed our babies ? What if the witches were those we 've entrusted to lead ? A member , perhaps , of our most esteemed board ? Well , I hope not , 'cause I 'm one of you now .」

Gloriana:「I simply wish to thank you ... for showing me the depth of your care yesterday in the public house .」
Cotton:「And so you have , Miss Embry . Though I assure you that separating you from that unsavory character was a mere act of charity .」
Gloriana:「Charity ?」
Cotton:「So , too , pity .」
Gloriana:「Pity and charity ?」
Cotton:「I 'm afraid .」
Gloriana:「And it had nothing to do with feeling ?」
Cotton:「[ Scoffs ] Not beyond the feeling I possess for any of God 's needy creatures ... a hungry child ... A wounded animal .」
Gloriana:「A whore ?」
Cotton:「Glori ... Miss Embry , you know I detest such words .」
Gloriana:「But in the house of the lord , there can be no deceit . Is n't that what you preach ? That a whore is a whore ? Just as one would never say " pity " when they meant " passion " ... " Charity " when they meant " envy . "」
Cotton:「Envy ?」
Gloriana:「At the thought of another man 's mouth on mine , his body pressed against mine ... His loins enveloped in mine .」
Cotton:「Lord , forgive her impiety .」
Gloriana:「Is that the same lord that you invoke from my bed as you thrust in and out of me ? The same lord that you thank as my tongue traces down your chest or up your thigh ? That same lord to which I pray that your promise to return will never be an empty one ?」

John:「What 's your point , magistrate ?」
Mr. Hale:「Perhaps it would have been wiser for me to simply tell you the truth about who and what I am .」
John:「And what 's that ?」
Mr. Hale:「A concerned father . Three days ago , my daughter was spelled ... or so I believe .」
John:「And yet when she asked , you ...」
Mr. Hale:「I lied ... yes . How could I let her know that there are those out there who wish to do her harm ? You see what they 've done to the Lewis girl , her mind no longer her own . What if my Anne is their next target ? You and I have a common enemy ... the witches who would do my Anne and all of us harm .」
John:「And who are they ?」
Mr. Hale:「This remains a mystery .」
John:「I must admit , uh ... I underestimated you .」
Mr. Hale:「Well , thank you .」

William:「[ Chuckles ] And yet are either actually required to point the finger in Salem ?」

Tituba:「And yet why would she accept it a second time ?」
Mary Sibley:「She would n't , unless there is some part of the girl to which we can appeal .」
Tituba:「And what part is that ?」
Mary Sibley:「The same part you once touched in me ... the deep , small piece of her that longs for a better life .」
Tituba:「You must move quickly , then . I , alone , will take charge of Mr. Hooke .」

Tituba:「I fear you and my mistress share a common adversary ... Mr. Hooke .」
John:「How did you know that he ...」
Tituba:「I saw you quarreling in the Warren off the square . He demands access to my mistress ' ship . Why ? To retrieve some worthless parcel , as he claims ? Or does he harbor darker intent ?」
John:「He plans to rob her .」
Tituba:「So my mistress fears .」
John:「Why did Mrs. Sibley allow him to board that vessel ?」
Tituba:「He left her no choice . He threatened to spread false rumor of an affair ...」

Mr. Hale:「Must I say his name ?」
narration:Was it not obvious to all who were present this evening ?
Anne:「Is it not a woman 's prerogative to choose which man she fancies ?」
Mr. Hale:「It is . Just as it is a father 's prerogative to protect his daughter 's heart from those he feels will do it harm . John Alden , for instance .」
Anne:「Why do you say this ? Because he does n't curry your favor , like every other twitchy young man in Salem ?」
Mr. Hale:「No . That is not it . How could he ever be yours truly when he always was and always will be Mary Sibley 's ?」
Anne:「Their history is no secret . But it is just that ... history . She is a married woman now .」
Mr. Hale:「And do you suppose Mary Sibley will idly stand by while you claim that which she rightfully considers to be her own ?」
Anne:「You fear her , father . I do not .」
Mr. Hale:「You are but a child . You do n't understand .」
Anne:「[ Chuckling ] A child ? A moment ago , you agreed I was a woman .」
Mr. Hale:「It 's not for debate .」
Anne:「By whose command ?」
Mr. Hale:「By mine ! Your father ! Your lord and master ! I forbid you to have further contact with Captain Alden !」
Anne:「Or what ? What punishment awaits me ? Will you crush the life from me , as you do your enemies ? Or just my spirit , as you do those you love ?」
Mr. Hale:「Quiet ! Not one word more !」

John:「I 'm not here on her behalf . Now put it down .」

John:「What ?」
William:「The cost of settling old scores . What would be the charge if the magistrate knew what you did ? Murder ? Treason ? Both ? [ Chuckles ]」

Mr. Hale:「Uh , Mrs. Sibley , uh , good afternoon . Might I borrow your girl ? The missus has taken ill with a batch of wayward mussels and now begs relief with one of her exceptional tonics .」
Mary Sibley:「Please send Mrs. Hale my most urgent regrets .」
Mr. Hale:「Most kind . Mm ?」
Mary Sibley:「Oh , Mr. Richards , uh , fetch for me a list of items this Mr. Hooke was here to receive , one that also perhaps includes their site of origin .」
Richards:「Right away , madam .」

Tituba:「Your lie is clumsy . No one is ill . My mistress can see that as clearly as I.」
Mr. Hale:「Yes , well , when it comes to lies and subterfuge , I defer to your expert endowments .」
Tituba:「State your purpose or be gone with you .」

Cotton:「Where did you say it came from ?」
John:「Where everything in this town comes from ... a ship .」
Cotton:「Ritum magni .」
John:「The grand rite ?」
Cotton:「Most of what we know is lore ... rumor , legend .」
narration:It says this object , this " malum , " has thought to be present at every grand rite throughout history . Everything I have read has said that the grand rite has only ever been attempted , never completed .
John:「Maybe plague 's only part of it .」
Cotton:「This object is evil . It consecrates the earth for the devil 's return .」
John:「It was here for delivery . Someone was expecting it .」
Cotton:「A witch . We must inform the selectmen immediately .」
John:「No .」
Cotton:「No ?」

Tituba:「The apotek . I run low on the bark of cascara sagrada .」
Mary Sibley:「By all means .」
Dottie:「It 's like the great flowing robe of the pope .」
Elizabeth:「Or the jeweled - up crown of a king .」
Mercy:「Well , it 's quite disagreeable on ... I assure you .」
Dottie:「Just think of it ... being led through the market by the handsome Reverend Mather . What 's he like , Mercy , hmm ? Does he speak of God and demons ?」

Dottie:「It 's her father . She 'd accuse her own father .」
Mercy:「Why ?」
Dottie:「Makes her sing in the streets all day long while he nurses the bottle at lamb 's ... sing and beg . Then he takes what coin she 's made for spirits and beats her senseless for her troubles .」
Mercy:「Is this true ?」
Emily:「I 'm to be 15 next month , and he swears to sell me to the rod .」

John:「Have I offended you , Miss Hale ?」
Anne:「Do you consider it offensive raising hope in a heart most normally well - guarded while your own beats in the breast of another ? Do you , Captain Alden , find that reprehensible or simply unkind ?」
John:「Well , I ...」

Mary Sibley:「Wonder what ?」

Rose:「If he 'd never left , if you 'd been allowed to marry , and found yourself now in that house of his with three squalling brats , working ceaselessly to spread your meager wages ... Would Captain Alden still hold such desperate appeal ? Or is it that you 're trapped in first bliss , romance from which there 's no escape , your heart ever hurting from the imaginings of what could have been ? Do not stare at him in public .

Mercy:「Okay .」

Mary Sibley:「But there was an evil king , and he sent the prince to his death . And the poor maiden , her heart turned gray as ash . One night , in her despair , a fairy came to her and promised her that all the world would be hers if she would but give up the last of her love for her dead prince . And though she wept to lose the only part of him that still lived deep inside her ... She did as she was told ... In the hopes that all her dreams might still come true . And so it came to pass that the ash maiden was brought to the king 's castle . There , she met a servant who hurried her inside . And through the scullery door , she watched the lords and ladies of the land enjoy a sumptuous feast with the evil king and his queen . And at this feast , a dark prince slew the old queen with an invisible wave of his hand ...」

George:「[ Grunting ]」
Mary Sibley:「But none of it hers .」
George:「[ Snoring ]」
Mary Sibley:「[ Vomits ] That night , she felt one monster on top of her and another inside . And she glimpsed what her soul was becoming and learned her first lesson as queen ... be careful what you wish for . She served as the queen to the evil king . For two years that felt like 2,000 . But when she could take no more , she begged the fairy to turn her back into the ash maiden . But the fairy refused and showed her all the kingdom that lay before her and said all this might still be hers .」
Rose:「You know why the mathers and the sibleys and the aldens and the other founding families really picked this spot to be their new Jerusalem ? This town will become one of the richest on earth . And who controls Salem controls the new world .」

Mary Sibley:「The ash maiden understood there was no turning back . She would embrace her role as queen and all the power that came with it . That night , for the first time , she would use that power . And that night , the whole world began to turn upside - down .」
