Wade Wilson:「Sweet and salty.」
MERCHANT:「The fuck are you? And what are you doing in my crib?!」
narrator:Without even turning toward Merchant, Wade PULLS OUT A .50 CALIBER DESERT EAGLE PISTOL and nonchalantly AIMS it at him. Merchant and Jeremy both go pale.
Wade Wilson:「to Jeremy) Burnt crust?」
JEREMY:「God I hope not. (opens the box, winces) Words cannot express-」

 Once you go black, you never go back! (takes pizza)」

Wade Wilson:「I ain't taking allowance money. Make sure it gets back to Ms. Osflorsky? Onroflensky? Olly-Olly-Oxen-Free?」

 WADE dead-man-walks to the back of the bar. He passes BOOTHE and BEEF on his way. They nod solemnly, like cops at a funeral procession honoring one of their own.

 Beef offers Wade his shot. Wade eeks out a smile. Throws it back. Then continues on. Wade stops next to the MAN's TABLE.
Wade Wilson:「Forget your scythe?」

RECRUITER:「Mr. Wilson. Have a seat. (Wade sits, long pause) I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.」
Wade Wilson:「Stalker alert.」
RECRUITER:「It's my job. Recruitment. And you have quite a reputation. I'm sorry you've had a tough go. But you're a fighter. And not just for Johnny Canuck, impressive as your stint in special forces was. Forty- one confirmed kills?」
Wade Wilson:「bitter) One every seven weeks.
 Same rate most folks get a hair-cut.」

 ABE lies shirtless on an UNSANITARY operating table, a tray of RUSTY surgical KNIVES nearby.
 A MAN with a pock-marked face stands over him in a white lab coat with blue-stitched cursive writing: `Dr. Delgado.'
DOCTOR:「Buenos días, Señor Abe.」
narrator:Doctor' Delgado pokes and prods with his fingers, as if Abe's mid-section is Play-Doh.
DOCTOR:「Voy a llegar dentro de tu cuerpo.」
narrator:ABE I'm sorry.
 No hablo español, doc.
 The doctor's other hand dips below the table, comes up dripping with something bloody. He kneeds at wrinkled skin smearing the CHICKEN BLOOD across Abe's flesh.
DOCTOR:「De que se cure! Señor Abe, you are cured.」
narrator:The doctor holds SMELLING SALTS under Abe's nose. His closed eyes jerk open to see the doctor's gloved hand CLUTCHING a huge, bloody `TUMOR.'
 Abe pushes himself up, peers down at his bloody abdomen with awe. The doctor wipes the blood away and helps him up.
 ABE (tearing up) Thank you. I owe you my life.
 As Abe shuffles out, the doctor turns away to dump the `tumor' in the trash and wash his bloody hands in a basin.

Wade Wilson:「Um. My first request?

narrator:Wade DOUBLE-TAKES at the sight of the figure above him: ANGEL DUST - thirties, female, tall, sexy, athletic - an Amazonian warrior in another age.
 Angel Dust wheels over a high-tech I.V. DRIP, complete with glass cylindrical tanks housing a glowing, viscous LIQUID.
 Then she roughly straps Wade's NECK to the table. Wade nearly GASPS, the color now officially drained from his face.
Wade Wilson:「Easy!
 Aren't you a little strong for a lady?
 I'm calling wang.」
ANGEL DUST:「You'd like that, huh.

Wade Wilson:「Something in your teeth.」
narrator:Ajax smiles WITHOUT opening his mouth, signals Angel Dust. She slams Wade's head back again as he turns to leave.
 Before he exits, Ajax hesitates, can't help but check his teeth in one of the surgical mirrors.
