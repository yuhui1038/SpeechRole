narrator:FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His manner is utterly genuine and convincing.
Fletcher Reede:「A dark street. . . a stormy night... two desperate men struggle... one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il. The prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open-and-shut case of a poor man, brutally victimized. He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.
 Well, for once I agree with t he prosecutor. This is an open-and shut case -- but the true victim is my client. Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.
 Put yourself in his shoes for a moment--walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the suburbs. As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM」

Fletcher Reede:「You're nervous, timid, looking over your shoulder -- when suddenly, you encounter him-- (pointing at the old man) pouncing from the shadows. You quiver in fear. The streetlight flashes on something shiny in his hand-- a knife?」
narrator:Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a weapon. The jurors RECOIL.
Fletcher Reede:「And in that terrifying instant you do what any respectable citizen would -- you defend y ou rse lf. Only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it's all a mistake... the man was merely walking away from an ATM machine, the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card. He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.」

Fletcher Reede:「· And why? Why does the State turn its massive power against this individual? (takes an」

 JUROR) But this time it's not based on race. (to a female
 JUROR) Not based on gender. (to a man wearing a crucifix) Not based on religion, (to a heavy set
 JUROR) No--this time it's discrimination based on size! . I know what the prosecution wants you to think - - i t ' s always the big guy's fault. Is that what we've come to as a society -- persecuting people because they're large? Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.
Fletcher Reede:「Shame on you, Mister Prosecutor! Shame on you! (turning back to」

Fletcher Reede:「Instead, let cold reason be your guide as you decide the fate of this church-going, orphan-rasing widower! Fletcher returns to his seat. Jurors, dab their eyes.」

Fletcher Reede:「he' s won) Another gratifying day serving Justice. Fletcher's huge client catches up to him.」
narrator:CLIENT Hey great job, Mr. Reid. I wish there was some way I could show my appreciation.

VIRGINIA:「This is good. This is really smart.」
Fletcher Reede:「Thank you.」
VIRGINIA:「Only i t ' s . . . Like not true. Every word of it is a lie. Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances.
 I mean... isn't that a problem?」
Fletcher Reede:「Mrs. Cole, the only problem here is that after you've provided years of faithful service and loving support, of raising his children -- They are his?」
VIRGINIA:「H m ? Oh yeah. One for sure.」

VIRGINIA:「Seven single acts of indiscretion.」
Fletcher Reede:「Seven acts of indiscretion, only one of which he has any evidence of, and all of which he himself is responsible, for.」

Fletcher Reede:「Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all night last night studying your c ase. Not just your case... b ut you. And, by now, I feel I know you. You are the victim here. The wife of a cold, distant businessman. Starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man--」
VIRGINIA:「Seven.」
Fletcher Reede:「not missing a」

Fletcher Reede:「And you've always been a good wife.」
VIRGINIA:「getting worked」
narrator:UP) Yeah. . .

Fletcher Reede:「There's such a thing as being t oo nice. That's why you need aggr essive representation. To show the court that there is more than one side to this st ory.

Fletcher Reede:「Good for you!」
VIRGINIA:「Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so grateful I have an attorney I can trust. S he gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves. Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door. She moves in on him.」
MIRANDA:「You're good. You're really good.」
Fletcher Reede:「Oh, pshaw. (pronounces it with the "p") She picks a piece of lint off.his jacket.」

MIRANDA:「S o . . . was it good for you? Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.」

BEGGAR:「Will you?」
Fletcher Reede:「No.」
BEGGAR:「How come?」
Fletcher Reede:「Because I resent your p re sen ce. You fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt. Further, I don't believe you'll use the money for food, but I believe you'll use it for, at worst, drugs, or, at best, whiskey, or . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap. As Fletcher heads up the stairs...」

DANA:「Fifty per cent? With a pre- nup and proof of adultery? What's your case?」

Fletcher Reede:「Yes, Your Honor.」
JUDGE STEVENS:「I take it you're seeking to substitute in as counsel?」
Fletcher Reede:「Yes, Your Honor.」

Fletcher Reede:「Mr. Rand had severe ethical objections to my client's case. Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.」

DANA:「Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband.」
JUDGE STEVENS:「Sounds pretty damning, Mr. Reid.」
Fletcher Reede:「It certainly does.」
DANA:「However, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute. Against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars.」
JUDGE STEVENS:「Two four seems like a pretty fair offer, Mr. Reid.」
Fletcher Reede:「Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In fact, I'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid. Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness refreshing.」
JUDGE STEVENS:「What are you suggesting, Mr. Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position?」

Fletcher Reede:「utterly sincere) No, not at all. She's got my client dead to rights. When」

narrator:attorneys go to sleep at night, they dream of having a case as strong as hers.
DANA:「Can the sarcasm, Reid. All right, I admit it -- I've seen you make even the lamest case fly. But this time I have you. Even Clarence Darrow couldn't explain this away. She brandishes the audiotape.」

Fletcher Reede:「The best that money can buy, Y o u r Honor.

Fletcher Reede:「We have evidence that you are not going to-believe. Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.」
JUDGE STEVENS:「You're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out, eh, Mr. Reid?」
Fletcher Reede:「hopeless) . "Confident" is too weak a word, Your Honor. I am certain what will happen if I take this puppy to trial. The verdict will be a stunning, humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees. Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles.」

 FLETCHER
 AUDREY--
 AUDREY' Hey, Fletcher. T was wondering if you were going to still pick up Max after school today.
Fletcher Reede:「I don't think I can. I had a case I was certain would settle and it didn't. I have to go to trial this afternoon, God help me.」

AUDREY:「not believing」
narrator:HIM) Right.
Fletcher Reede:「It's true... I really do want to see Max, today. Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true.
 How about that. I really do.」
narrator:AUDREY
 CYNICALLY) But things keep coming up at the last minute.
Fletcher Reede:「Yes, but-this time it's different.」
AUDREY:「I see. And how is that?」
narrator:
Fletcher Reede:「he walked into」
narrator:IT) This time I'm telling the truth.
AUDREY:「But last night you weren't?」
Fletcher Reede:「No.」
AUDREY:「What were you doing?」
Fletcher Reede:「Having sex.」
AUDREY:「barely holding her temper), It must have been with someone very "special."」
Fletcher Reede:「No. It was with someone I don't even like. But I thought it would help my career and at the moment that」

narrator:The Volvo parks. Audrey gets out. She leans over to say good-bye to her son.

 .
MAX:「Is dad picking me up?」
AUDREY:「No, I'm sorry, Max. He can't make it. I will. I'll work it out. Max is disappointed.」
MAX:「I guess my wish didn't come · true.」
AUDREY:「What wish?」
MAX:「I wished that, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. Max heads toward his teacher. Audrey is deeply moved.」
narrator:INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE
 He's dialing the phone.
Fletcher Reede:「Answer, answer, answer...」

AUDREY:「Hello.」
Fletcher Reede:「Audrey, let me explain. Something has happened to me--」
AUDREY:「Fletcher, something else is about to happen to you.」
narrator:FLETCHER. What do you mean?
AUDREY:「Max and I are moving to Boston.」
Fletcher Reede:「What?!」
AUDREY:「Jerry asked me to marry him. He wants Max and I to fly with him this weekend to pick out a house. And I'm going to go. God knows I don't have any reason to stay here.」
Fletcher Reede:「panicking)
 . Wait, you can't move! If you take Max away... I'll practically never see him.」
AUDREY:「Well then you'll have pretty much the same relationship you have with him now.」
Fletcher Reede:「Audrey, please.... Is this because of what I just said on the phone?」
AUDREY:「That was the straw and this is the camel's back saying goodbye.」
Fletcher Reede:「Where are you?」

Fletcher Reede:「When you gee there, stay there. I'll be right over. We have to talk.」
narrator:AUDREY
 FLETCHER--
Fletcher Reede:「I'll be right- there!」

narrator:He hangs up and heads for the door.
 It opens and Miranda enters.
Fletcher Reede:「Aaaah!」
MIRANDA:「Flet cher. Fletcher, Fletcher, Fletcher. I must confess-- after last night's incident, I was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was tempted to do whatever little things lie in my power to scuttle your chances of making partner. Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.
 But then I thought, "No, that 's not fair. Fletcher didn't mean to insult me."」
narrator:STRAIGHTENING his tie) "It was just some massive, boneheaded misunderstanding, and Fletcher is very, very sorry." Fletcher smiles.
 It looks like he's off the hook, until--
MIRANDA:「Isn't that right, Fletcher?」
Fletcher Reede:「in agony) Uh -- not really, no.」

Fletcher Reede:「None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d like to respect you, and if it weren't for your mistreatment of the associates, your rudeness to the staff, and the fact that your work sucks, I would.」
narrator:M IRANDA But -- what about last night?
Fletcher Reede:「I was afraid you wouldn't support my partnership if I turned you down. Plus, I have an immature need for sexual conquests.」
narrator:INT. HALLWAY OF LAW OFFICES - MORNING
 W e HEAR A SMACK! The door flies opens -- and a furious Miranda stalks off.
 INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE - MORNING
 Fletcher rubs his freshly SLAPPED FACi..
 INT. BMW - MOVING / EXT, STREET - MORNING
 Fletcher speeds away. He pulls the blue pen from his pocket.
Fletcher Reede:「Gotta focus. . . gotta focus. He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and almost hits an OLD MAN.
 The color of the pen is -- re d !
 . But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a truck. The DRIVER screams:」
narrator:DRIVER What's your problem, schmuck?!

Fletcher Reede:「the truth) I ' m an inconsiderate prick!」

narrator:Fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen.
Fletcher Reede:「CON "ID) C'mon, you can do this! The color of the pen is -- RED! This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a POLICE CAR in his rearview mirror.」

narrator:Fletcher pulls over. A POLICE OFFICER strolls up.
POLICE OFFICER:「Do you know why I stopped you?」
Fletcher Reede:「Depends on how long you were following me.」
POLICE OFFICER:「Why don't we take it from the top.」
Fletcher Reede:「in agony) Here goes -- I didn't fasten my seatbelt, I didn't glance in my rearview mirror, I didn't signal when I pulled away from the curb, I sped, I followed too closely, I ran a stop sign, I almost hit :a Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a ge ezer, I sped some more, I failed to yield at a crosswalk, I changed lanes in the intersection, I changed lanes without signalling, and I changed lanes in the」
narrator:INTERSECTION-WITHOUT signalling while running a red light and speeding. A long moment.
POLICE OFFICER:「May I see your driver's license?」
Fletcher Reede:「No.」

POLICE OFFICER:「And why is that?」
Fletcher Reede:「It's in my other pants.」
POLICE OFFICER:「I see. And where are your · other pants?」
Fletcher Reede:「Hanging from my boss's credenza.」
POLICE OFFICER:「Do you expect me to believe that?」
Fletcher Reede:「No.」

POLICE OFFICER:「Do you think I'm an idiot?」
Fletcher Reede:「Yes -- but that's beside the point! My license actually is in my other pants, and they actually were hanging from a credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to you! I mean, I would if I could, but I can't!」
POLICE OFFICER:「I see. So you ..have no reason to try and hide your license from me?」
Fletcher Reede:「I didn't say that. I have other reasons. Seventeen reasons, to be precise. (begrudgingly, off the officer's look) Unpaid parking tickets.」

Fletcher Reede:「Audrey, wait!」
AUDREY:「Wait? You know, I just had an insight into myself. I ' m crazy. You call me up and . tell me to wait here because you'll be right over and -- here's the crazy part -- I actually wait.」
Fletcher Reede:「I can explain--」
AUDREY:「I missed a department meeting. I. . . Did you come in a cab?」
Fletcher Reede:「Yes.」

narrator:Audrey finishes paying the impound-yard CASHIER and joins Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars.
Fletcher Reede:「Thank you. . I can't tell you how much this means to me.」
AUDREY:「I can. One thousand, six hundred, and fifty-four dollars and eleven cents.」
Fletcher Reede:「Ow.」

narrator:At this moment WE HEAR a hideous scraping noise -- and a TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE whips Fletcher's BMW into view and. parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door.
Fletcher Reede:「You scratched my car!」
narrator:TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE Where?
 .
Fletcher Reede:「Right there!」

narrator:TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE Oh that? That was already there.
 FLETCHER
 OUTRAGED) Why, you -- you liar! Do you know what I ' m going to do about this?
 TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE What?
Fletcher Reede:「angrier and」
narrator:ANGRIER) ...Nothing! Because if I take you to small-claims court, it will just drain eight hours out of my life, and you probably won't show up, and if I finally got the judgment you'd just stiff me anyway, so what I'm gonna do is piss and moan like an impotent jerk and . then bend over and take it up the tail pipe!
 TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE You've been here before, haven't you? He flips Fletcher the keys and goes.
AUDREY:「Well I can't remember when I've had more fun, now if you'll excuse me, I have a class. She starts out.」
Fletcher Reede:「Audrey, wait. I want to talk to you about this Boston situation.」
narrator:AUDREY What do you want to say?
Fletcher Reede:「You can't go. It's not fair. Taking Max three thousand miles away is not fair.」

AUDREY:「Let' s define "fair." Last · night a five-year old boy was crushed because his father lied to him about coming to his birthday party. Fair?」
Fletcher Reede:「Last night--」
AUDREY:「Was none of my business. When it happened two years ago it was my business, but now I don't have to care anymore. See, that's the magic of div orce . But it does matter to Max. Everything you do matters to him... and everything you don't do.」
Fletcher Reede:「All right-- now let me tell you something...you're absolutely right. I'm guilty of all charges. I'm throwing myself on the mercy of your -court. Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very sincere, but she can't trust him.」
narrator:FLETCHER {I have an idea. I'll come over tonight, right after court lets out and play with M ax. Have him invite some fri ends over. We'll have a game and everything. Then, you and I can sit down and talk.
AUDREY:「We're suppose to be on a plane」
narrator:TONIGHT--
Fletcher Reede:「No, Audrey. Just talk to me abou t this first. Please. Au drey, I've lost you. Don't make me lose Max, too.」

Fletcher Reede:「This is iron-clad. This is the mother of all promises. What time?」
AUDREY:「Six?」
Fletcher Reede:「Ten-to-six.」

narrator:As Audrey gets in her car -- .
AUDREY:「I hope so. Do you know what your son was doing at nine- fif teen las t ni ght? He was making a wish on his birthday c ake. He was wishing that, for just one day, his dad couldn't tell a lie. She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive, when a new thought strikes him.」
Fletcher Reede:「Oh my God! That-'s it! An innocent kid - - a heartfelt plea-- a birthday wish! Sure, it' s impossible --but it 'makes sense!..! If he can wish it, he can unwish it!」

narrator:MS . BERRY Are you Max's dad? I ' m Ms. Berry, Max's teacher!
Fletcher Reede:「Hi. Listen, I need to talk to」
narrator:MAX--
 MS. BERRY Mr. Reid, we were just talking ab ou t careers. You're a lawyer, aren't you?
 FLETCHER
 WARY) Yes.
MAX:「Mr. Reid it'would be wonderful for the children to hear something positive about lawyers!」
Fletcher Reede:「Well, actually-- ·」
narrator:MS. BERRY Children! .Mr. Reid is going to tell us what it's like to be a lawyer. She leads the kids in APPLAUSE. Fletcher takes center s tage. The children stare, rapt with attenion.
Fletcher Reede:「Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and I work at a big law firm with a lot of other lawyers and I do stuff in a law court. Thank you. He starts out.」

narrator:JEFF What kind of lawyer are you?
Fletcher Reede:「Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer.」
narrator:BILLY What's that?
Fletcher Reede:「It means if you're daddy left your mommy, he'd call me.」
narrator:CRAIG So what do you do?
Fletcher Reede:「growing more and more impatient) I help people fight over their money and their children.」
narrator:THEODORE Can't they fight without you?
 FLETCHER ' " They could but then J wouldn't make a living.
 JILL Why would my daddy leave my mommy?
Fletcher Reede:「To marry a younger woman. To escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death. The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then:」

Fletcher Reede:「Monster-Max.」

MAX:「Dadzilla. You came to play catch?」
Fletcher Reede:「No. I ' d like to, but I can't right now. Max is disappointed again.
 I ' m sorry I missed your party la st night. How was your Uncle Glen?」
MAX:「Stupid. His big nose and stupid orange hair...」
Fletcher Reede:「That's why he should have worn make-up. Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh. Max doesn't laugh.」
narrator:MAX . I want to play kickball with my friends.-
Fletcher Reede:「Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. It came true. Max is amazed.」
MAX:「Really? You mean you have to tell the truth?」
Fletcher Reede:「Yes.」

MAX:「No matter what?」
Fletcher Reede:「No matter what.」

narrator:Max grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession.
MAX:「Is wrestling real?」
Fletcher Reede:「In the Olympics, yes.
 On
 . Channel 23, no.」
MAX:「Will sitting close to the TV set make me go blind?」
Fletcher Reede:「Not in a million years.」
MAX:「If I keep making this face-- (makes a horrible」
narrator:FACE) will it get stuck that way?
Fletcher Reede:「Uh-uh.」
MAX:「If I go in the water right after lunch, will I drown?」
Fletcher Reede:「Only if you can't 'swim.」
MAX:「Why do I have to eat squash?」
Fletcher Reede:「Because your mom buys it.」
MAX:「How come you're always too busy to play with me? The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels awful.」
Fletcher Reede:「I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey, you know I'm coming over to nig ht. We're gonna play together.」

Fletcher Reede:「Yes! This is absolutely an A-number one promise. You and I -- tonight -- baseball. Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap.
 Now, listen, Max, I need a favor from you. I ' m in a little trouble today. I need you to take that wish back.」
MAX:「So you can lie?」
Fletcher Reede:「Not to you.」
MAX:「To who?」
Fletcher Reede:「Max, sometimes grownups... need to lie. It's hard to explain, but i f . . . Look, here's an example. When Mommy was pregnant with you, she gained a little weight. Se venty pounds. I thought she was gonna give birth to a car. But she'd say to me "How do I lo ok?" So I'd say, "Oh, honey, you're beautiful, you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I would've hurt Mommy's fee ling s. Understand? Max nods.」
MAX:「You didn't think she was beautiful.」
Fletcher Reede:「Right. No... Max, I don't know how to get along in the grown-up world if I have to stick to the truth. I could lose my case, I could lose my promotion, I could even lose, my job... Do you understand? Max shakes his head "no."」

Fletcher Reede:「Will you help me anyway? A moment -- then Max reluctantly nods.
 That's my boy! Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... He takes out two birthday hats. He puts one on Max and one on himself.
 Now, do whatever you did last night... only this time, make an un-wish. Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake. He takes a breath-- and blows them out.」
MAX:「I did it. ^」
Fletcher Reede:「Great! Great! Now to test --」

narrator:Fletcher spots an attractive FEMALE teacher. Fletcher hurries to her and says something. A moment. Then she
 SLAPS HIM. Fletcher returns to his son.
MAX:「Did it work?」
narrator:FLETCHER
 .
 . (rubbing his sore
 CHEEK) Not like I ' d hoped. Did you really unwish it? Max nods.
MAX:「Only...」
Fletcher Reede:「Only what?」

Fletcher Reede:「losing patience) Well, then do it again.
 Only this time, mean it.」
MAX:「I can't.」
Fletcher Reede:「Why not?!」
MAX:「Because I don't want you to lie.」
Fletcher Reede:「I explained this to you! I have to lie. Everybody lies! Mommy lies, even the wonderful Jerry lies--」
narrator:
MAX:「But you're the only one who makes me feel bad.」
narrator:Fletcher is stunned by how much this hurts.
 MS. BERRY
 CALLING) Max, recess 'is over, come on in.
MAX:「I have to go.」
Fletcher Reede:「I am coming over, tonight, Max. You believe me, don't you? Max hesitates, then nods.
 I'll see you tonight, buddy... That's a promise. Max heads back to class. Fletcher picks up the cake, looks at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel.」

narrator:MACHO ATTORNEY Yo, Fletcher! How's it hanging?
Fletcher Reede:「Short and shrivelled. Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him anyway.」
PHILIP:「Fletcher! I'm still waiting for your call. I guess you must've lost my card --」
Fletcher Reede:「No --」
PHILIP:「Or my phone was busy --」
Fletcher Reede:「No --」

PHILIP:「Or you just forgot --」
Fletcher Reede:「No --」
PHILIP:「cannot be」
narrator:DISCOURAGED) Or something. So anyway,' why don't you swing by my place around seven-thirty! Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him resolutely.
Fletcher Reede:「Philip... I don't want to come over to your house! A long moment, then --」

narrator:Fletcher drags himself past Greta's desk. Miranda gives him the stink-eye. Fletcher doesn't see her.
GRETA:「Do you want your messages?」
Fletcher Reede:「No. He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.
 She follows him in, leaving his door open.」

narrator:Fletcher collapses onto his couch. Greta enters.
GRETA:「Are you okay?」
Fletcher Reede:「My son hates me.」
GRETA:「No! He loves you. I've seen y ou together. You're his hero.」
Fletcher Reede:「O h yeah? Last night at his birthday party, he made a ·wish. That I wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day.」
GRETA:「Kids...」
Fletcher Reede:「It came true.」
GRETA:「What?」
Fletcher Reede:「It's true. Didn't it seem odd to you that I kept telling the truth all morning?」

narrator:INCREDULOUS) You're telling me that you can't lie.
Fletcher Reede:「That's right!
 I am incapable of lying.」

GRETA:「Just today?」
Fletcher Reede:「Apparently until 9:15 tonight. It's a twenty-four hour curse.」
GRETA:「Yes, those are going around.」
Fletcher Reede:「You don't believe me.」
GRETA:「Of course not.」
Fletcher Reede:「Go ahead. Ask me something I ' d normally lie about. She thinks.」

narrator:BUTTONS) Hello... Mom!! The phone flies into the air. He catches it.
 FLETCHER {Mom... Well, I wasn't actually on vacation... Because I didn't want to talk to you... Because you insist on talking to me about Dad's bowel movements -- size, color, frequency... I'll call you later... No, not really. He pushes -two more buttons. Then SCREAMS.
Fletcher Reede:「Oh dammit! I cut him off! I cut off the Judge! Greta... He falls to his knees.
 I'm on my knees in a nine hundred dollar suit. Don't leave. Greta stops.
 She seems to consider.」
GRETA:「A few years ago a friend of mine had a burglar up on her roof.」

 Would the Court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break?」
JUDGE STEVENS:「It can't wait?」
Fletcher Reede:「Not unless you want to mop up.」

Fletcher Reede:「What did I think? That I could piss for forty-five minutes?! He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea.

FALK:「How are you?」
Fletcher Reede:「I've slipped into the seventh circle of Hell, thank you, and you? Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.」
VIRGINIA:「Shouldn't we go over our testimony?」
Fletcher Reede:「Well, basically the plan is I walk you through the tape step by step, I ask you questions--」

Fletcher Reede:「Exactly.」

FALK:「So all we have to do is lie. Sounds simple enough.」
Fletcher Reede:「Do esn't it? And I'll finish up with a dramatic series of questions, something like... "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that you and Mrs. Cole have never made lo--" But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT.

 DRAMATICALLY) Your Honor, I call Virginia Cole to the stand. Stunned, Virginia nervously makes her way up,
 MR. ALLAN (in the gallery) What the hell is he doing?
MIRANDA:「Kissing his career goodbye. The Baliff stands before the witness.」
narrator:BALIFP Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help -you God?
VIRGINIA:「I do. Fletcher approaches,. CONFIDENT NOW, COCKY.」
Fletcher Reede:「Mrs. Cole -- may I call you Virginia?」
VIRGINIA:「Yes.」
Fletcher Reede:「But that would be a lie, wouldn't it?」
VIRGINIA:「What do you mean?」
Fletcher Reede:「Isn't your true name...」

VIRGINIA:「Well, yes. But it wasn't me so I started using Virginia. Is there anything wrong with that?」
narrator:FLETCHER
 ·. Not really. It's just the first and smallest in the tissue of lies that is the Kleenex of your life. Let's take one simple document as a sample of your veracity, shall we, Carlotta? He grabs her purse from the desk, rifles through it,
 F LETCHER Your driver's license. What color are your eyes?
VIRGINIA:「Blue.」
Fletcher Reede:「Tru e blue? What if I asked you to remove your contact l enses? What color would they be then?」
narrator:VIRGINIA
 RELUCTANTLY) Brown.
Fletcher Reede:「And here it says you're a b l on de . Are you? (off her silence) C'mon, Carlotta, there's a very easy way for us to check. If you don't remember, perhaps Mr. Falk will.」

narrator:off his look) One-twenty-six. I swear!
Fletcher Reede:「So on this single document, you basically lied at every opportunity. I'm sure a woman as vain as you would also lie about her age. It says you were born in 1964. What's the truth? 1962? '60? How young did you try to make yourself?」
narrator:VIRGINIA
 JOYFULLY) Wrong! I didn't lie to make myself younger. I made myself older. I was born in 1965!"
 FLETCHER
 FEIGNING
 SURPRISE) What? You're trying to tell us you lied to make yourself older?
VIRGINIA:「Yes! " lied so I could get married! So .there Mister 'I」
narrator:GOT-ALL-THE-ANSWERS-BECAUSE-I- went-to-law-school'!
JUDGE STEVENS:「Mr. Reid, does this have a point?」
Fletcher Reede:「Oh, you bet it does, your Honor! (on a roll) My client lied about her age because she was only 17 when s he got married. Which makes h er a minor. And in the great state of California, NO MINOR」

Fletcher Reede:「knows he has」

narrator:Fletcher freezes.
Fletcher Reede:「What?」
VIRGINIA:「re: her husband) Payback. For him trying to prevent me from collecting my thirty-seven million.」
Fletcher Reede:「He was entitled to prevent you. You committed adultery.' You only won because you're a liar, remember? .」
VIRGINIA:「No. You pointed out that my husband took advantage of a poor underage girl. I was the vic tim here. And now I'm going to hit him where it hurts.」
Fletcher Reede:「But -- but -- you said he was a good father.」
JUDGE STEVENS:「M r. Reid? Do we have an agreement on custody or not? Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.」
Fletcher Reede:「No.
 .」

VIRGINIA:「Stop that! We're leaving now!」
narrator:CHILD I want to go with Daddy.
 V,'
 Fletcher watches, horrified, as she drags the kids away from their tearful father.
 MR. COLE Don't worry. I'll see you no matter what. I promise. Mr. Allan has made his way up to Fletcher.
 MR. ALLAN (re: the
 COMMOTION) I love kids. They give you so much leverage in a case like this. (pats Fletcher on
 BACK) Congratulations, partner. how does it feel? And with that question asked, as he watches poor Mr. Cole and his kids, the truth dawns on Fletcher like a sledgehammer!
 FLETCHER ' Excuse me. Just a second. (to the Judge) Y our Honor? Your Honor? Wait!
JUDGE STEVENS:「We',re adjourned, Mr. Reid.」
Fletcher Reede:「Screw that!! She lies and she wins ?! What are we, nuts? Everyone stops, watches Fletcher.
 T his woman --my client -- goes down with the frequency of a nuclear submarine and we just gave her thirty seven million dollars because she's a liar! And now as an extra added little bonus, we're going to let her steal, the kids, too?」

JUDGE STEVENS:「Mr. Reid, you are out of order!」
narrator:FLETCHER
 SCREAMING)
 SO'S THE HAND DRYER IN THE MEN'S ROOM!! Do you ever stop to ask yourself, why do people hate us? Could it be because what we did here today sucks?! We don't care about the truth! We don't want to find the t r u th ! We want to win! We want to win at all costs...and you know what the worst thing about wanting to win so badly i s ? WINNING! Winning and finding out you're left with nothing!
JUDGE STEVENS:「That's enough, Mr. Reid --」
Fletcher Reede:「Let' s see what I' ve done today. I've helped a gold digging slut get richer. I'm taking this guy's kids away. (to Mr. Allan) I don't like you in the least, now I'm one of your partners!」

JUDGE STEVENS:「Bailiff! Remove Mr. Reid from the courtroom!」
Fletcher Reede:「Yo u wanna know the truth? Oh yeah, let's let it rain... The truth is is that I've traded my life...a beautiful wife, an incredible son for THIS PISS」

Fletcher Reede:「Audrey!
 It's Fletcher--」
narrator:AUDREY
 PISSED) I can't talk now, Fletcher. We have to pack.
Fletcher Reede:「Wait, the most amazing thing's happened to me! I am feeling so good...」

Fletcher Reede:「A ud rey , wait. Please, I need to talk to you. I .swear, I'm a changed man. Just come to the courthouse with a thousand dollars and bail me out... Hello? (to a cop) O ne more call!! I need another call!!」

narrator:Fletcher is pacing back and forth. A GROUP OF TOUGH PRISONERS are on the far side of the cell, trying to stay as far away from Fletcher as they can.
Fletcher Reede:「And what about our water su pply ? You don't think "the man's" dumped enough toxins to render every dick in this cell as lifeless as a beached minn ow? You're damn rightJ "The man" does anything he w an ts. We're nothing but pu ppets... Little game pieces they move back and forth. A DEPUTY appears.

 FLETCHER
 WEAKLY) Greta? Is that you? He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY waiting for him just outside the door. Max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still ANGRY. He sees his dad, then quickly turns away.
Fletcher Reede:「to Audrey and Jerry, trying to seem chipper) Sorry I made you miss your flight, not really. (no response) You're obviously a little . upset, not that I blame you... although I'll bet you'll still get the bonus miles. . .」
AUDREY:「Fletcher, are you crazy? What were you doing?」
narrator:FLETC HER That's two questions. A; Yes, but I think the legal term is temporarily insane. And B; I was trying to finally have that talk with you about Boston. Audrey's patience are growing thin...
Fletcher Reede:「Okay, okay... The whole truth and nothing but the truth, (with difficulty,」

Fletcher Reede:「I know you've met somebody... somebody pretty great... and the truth is I wish you didn't but you did and... All I ' m asking i s . . . Please don't move to Boston. Please don't take Max away. She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced.」
AUDREY:「You can come visit anytime. It's only a four hour flight.」
Fletcher Reede:「I don't want to visit him. That's what I've been doing-- visiting him, dropping by, stopping in. I want to be in his life. I don't want to be some jerk that sees him at Easter. I want to be his father. Fletcher turns to Jerry.
 I know I have no right to ask, but can I talk you out of taki ng that job? I can get you a better job here in L.A. I've got all kinds of connect ions... what do you do again?」
JERRY:「I design security systems.」
Fletcher Reede:「How symbolic. Okay great. You know Pac-Tec?」
JERRY:「The biggest.」
Fletcher Reede:「One of their systems shorted out and burned down a supermarket. I got them off. Another proud day for justice. If I ask them they'll beat your Boston offer in two s ec on ds .

AUDREY:「Don't put Jerry in the middle.」
JERRY:「It's okay. (to Fletcher) Boston means this (snaps his」
narrator:FINGERS) to me. All I want is for this lady and Max to be happy. Preferably, with me. Whatever they want, I'll go along with. They both look to Audrey.
AUDREY:「All I want is for Max to be happy. Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the stairs. He's still upset.
 You better know your jury. You're hot exactly Max's hero today.」
Fletcher Reede:「Just let me present my case. Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,」
narrator:TALKING LIKE THE TERMINATOR.
 FLETCHER/TERMINATOR I have been sent from the future to destroy you. . . Argghhh! (no response, a
 BEAT) You mad at me? Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:
Fletcher Reede:「You wanted me to stop lying. But lying isn't the problem. .. Why we lie ~ that's the problem. Sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better. But sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way... (touches him) But being an adult means you sacrifice some things for more」

narrator:important things. Much more important things. I was so stupid, Max. (pointing to his own head) Malfunction in vector one. All this time you've been here and I could see you anytime I felt like it. And I... didn't. Please don't go to Boston. Max, I love you more than anything else in the world and you know it's true. I couldn't say it if it weren't true. Not today. A moment as Max studies his father, then:
MAX:「to Audrey) He's telling the truth, Mom. He's not allowed to lie. I made a wish and anything Dad says has to be the truth. (to Fletcher) .. Right? But Fletcher's looking at his watch...」
Fletcher Reede:「Max. .. it's 9:22.」
AUDREY:「What?」
Fletcher Reede:「Max, you made the wish at 9:15. I've been able to lie for the last seven minutes. Max steps away from Fletcher.」
MAX:「So then, you were...」
Fletcher Reede:「No! It wasn't a lie. I just wanted to be honest with you and tell you -- there was no wish to guarantee it anymore. You just have to believe me. Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.」

MAX:「to Audrey) Mommy... do we have to go to Boston? Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.」
narrator:AUDR EY No.
 We don't have to. Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll never let you go."
MAX:「to Fletcher) Can we play catch tomorrow? Fletcher smiles. . .」

 MAX) Here you go, mom. (Max screams) Oh, you mean with a ball... He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man.
Fletcher Reede:「I take back every dirty, dishonest thing I ever said about you, wrote about you, faxed about you, E-mailed about you.」
JERRY:「Appreciated. Fletcher tosses the baseball up and down.」
Fletcher Reede:「So, you up for a little friendly competition?」
JERRY:「No, you go play with your son.」
Fletcher Reede:「I wasn't talking about basesball. A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the ball to Max.
