 DET. GALLAGHER You see this? He picks up a PHOTO from the floor, hands it to Fine.
 DET. GALLAGHER Shaking hands with the President.
 DET. FINE You're saying this guy was a spook? You think this might be a political murder?
 DET. GALLAGHER I think that this is way bigger than the both of us. He leaves Det. Fine to ponder this.
 EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
 Outside Blake's apartment building. It's later now, the news stand is closed, businesses closed, people gone. We move into someone's POV. The person stares up at the broken window of Blake's apartment, now covered with PLASTIC
 SHEETING.
Rorschach:「V.0.) Rorschach's Journal, October 12th. Earlier today I came across what appeared to be a suicide. It was later learned to be a homicide. Someone's time was up. Still in POV, we see the person pull something from his pocket--the happy face pin. We realize that this was the person whose POV we were in earlier.
 V.0.) I discovered a clue. Something I recognized. And suddenly, unexpectedly . I heard my own clock ticking. We move out of the POV and see our guy for the first time-- RORSCHACH (roar-shock)--a masked vigilante who wears a trench coat, fedora, and a silver-white MASK with oily BLACK SPOTS moving about, creating shifting, doubled PATTERNS like a Rorschach test. Scary looking. Rorschach draws a hydraulic GRAPPLING GUN from his coat, and FIRES the HOOK AND CABLE THIRTY STORIES UP where it latches itself through Blake's broken window. Pressing RETRACT, Rorschach FLIES UP THE WALL to the 30th floor.」

narrator:INT. SUBWAY - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
 Dan rides the subway, lost in thought, when a group of GANG MEMBERS, wearing yellow and black BANDANAS brush past him. ONE stops. Dan's leg is out, a couple inches too far.
GANG LEADER:「Move your leg.」
DAN:「What?」
GANG LEADER:「I said move, dick. Dan finally realizes what he's talking about. Dan meets his eyes, for just a moment and draws back his leg. The Gang Members snicker at Dan as they pass.」
narrator:EXT. DAN DREIBERG'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
 Dan walks down the empty street to his TOWNHOUSE, digging for his keys. Then he stops, suddenly alert. His front door hangs slightly OPEN--the LOCK'S been SMASHED. There's a LIGHT on inside. Cautious, Dan enters the house.
 INT. DAN DREIBERG'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
 Dan quietly approaches the light coming from his kitchen. He hears odd, metal scraping SOUNDS.
 INT. DAN'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
 Dan enters the kitchen, stunned to find--
DAN:「Rorschach. Rorschach sits at the table, mask half up, eating a cold CAN」
narrator:OF BEANS.
Rorschach:「Hello Daniel. I helped myself to some beans. You don't mind?」

DAN:「No, of course not. You uh, want me to heat some up for you?」
Rorschach:「No need.」

narrator:CONTINUED: Rorschach finishes the can of beans, stands, pulls his mask back down. There's a strong familiarity between the two but at the same time, Dan is wary.
DAN:「You were on the news. They say you attacked a cop.」
Rorschach:「Minor wound. Won't need hospitalization.」
DAN:「Other than that . How have you been keeping?」
Rorschach:「Out of prison. So far. Look at this. He tosses Blake's happy face pin onto the table. Dan picks it up, runs his fingers over the RED-BROWN SPLOTCH.」
DAN:「This little stain, is that bean juice or--」
Rorschach:「Human bean juice. It belonged to the Comedian. He's dead.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
Rorschach:「Murder. Someone threw him out a window.」
DAN:「Maybe it was a burglary. The killer might not have known who Blake was.」
Rorschach:「An ordinary burglar? Kill the Comedian? Ridiculous.」
DAN:「You're right. I heard he was working for the government. Maybe it was a political killing.」
Rorschach:「Maybe. Or maybe someone's decided to kill off costumed heroes.」
DAN:「You don't think that's . a little paranoid?」
Rorschach:「Is that what they're saying about me now? That I'm paranoid?」
DAN:「I-'m just saying the Comedian made a lot of enemies over the years, even amongst his friends, if he had any. The man wasn't exactly endearing. Just because something happened to him doesn't mean it involves us.」
Rorschach:「One of our own has been murdered. I thought you might be interested. An attack on one is an attack on all of us, right? Dan hesitates.」
DAN:「I'm out, Rorschach. I've been out, we've all been out. Except you. You know that.」

Rorschach:「Yes. I know that. Anyways, I thought I'd let you know. Just in case.」

narrator:CONTINUED: (2)
DAN:「Yeah, thanks. You can take the tunnel out to the warehouse on Fleet street-- Rorschach turns to walk off down a long, dark TUNNEL.」
Rorschach:「I remember. Used to come here a lot. Back when we were partners.」
DAN:「Yeah. Those were good times, Rorschach. Great times. (more to himself) What ever happened to them?」
Rorschach:「You quit. Rorschach disappears into the SUBWAY TUNNEL, leaving Dan to reminisce alone. Dan glances at his old costume hanging.」

narrator:INT. SLEAZY MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING
 The kind of room you rent by the hour. Or the minute even. A cheap looking HOOKER enters with an ARMY OFFICER, giggling. She playfully pushes the Officer onto the bed.
 HOOKER So tell me what you wanna do. Sir.
 ARMY OFFICER Seeing that I don't have to be back to base till Friday--everything. He puts a stack of BILLS on the dresser. Then takes his UNIFORM off like he can't wait. The Hooker gets on top of him- --when the DOOR FLIES OFF THE HINGES. Rorschach steps in, yanks the Hooker off-- --the officer gets to his feet, throws a punch, which Rorschach dodges. Rorschach GRABS the guy's arm, then KICKS the Officer on the side of his KNEE, tearing the joint to shreds. The Officer cries out in pain, falls to the floor-- Rorschach nails him in the head with a BLACK JACK, knocking him out. The Hooker screams. Rorschach grabs her by the hair and SLAMS her face into the wall.
Rorschach:「Quiet, whore.」

narrator:EXT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - EVENING
 A SIGN posted on a RAZOR-WIRE FENCE reads: ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER. An M16-toting GUARD stands at the gate. We move into Rorschach's POV as he approaches the gate. The guard has no reaction to Rorschach-- --because Rorschach is in disguise, wearing the Army Officer's uniform he stole. Rorschach presents his ID. The Guard waves him through.
 INT. HALLWAY - DR. MANHATTAN'S COMPOUND - EVENING
 Rorschach ditches the uniform in the trash and puts his mask on. He quietly enters--
 INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS
 a huge room, which contains technologically advanced MILITARY DEVICES. Distorted in sections of GLASS, we see the REFLECTION of a HUGE MAN, GLOWING BRIGHT BLUE--
 DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.) Good evening, Rorschach. --and we see DR. MANHATTAN (formerly Jon Osterman) for the very first time. He is SIXTY FEET TALL, BLUE LIGHT ripples from his skin, emanating pure power--he is God on earth. He works on a reactor--telekinetically moving parts in the air-- not even looking at Rorschach. It's as if Dr. Manhattan already knew he was coming.
Rorschach:「Dr. Manhattan. Dr. Manhattan continues about his business when his girlfriend, LAURIE JUPITER, 30, very much in her prime, enters from the other end.」

LAURIE:「Jon, did you say some--Rorschach: What are you doing here? You're a wanted man.」
Rorschach:「Nice to see you too, Silk Spectre.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
Rorschach:「Sorry, Miss Jupiter. I thought I should tell you the bad news--the Comedian has been murdered.」
narrator:DR. MANHATTAN Yes, since he and I are the only two extranormal operatives currently employed by the government, I was informed. The CIA suspects one of the radical Islamic groups. Dr. Manhattan shrinks from sixty to six feet in size. He speaks in a cold, even, matter of fact manner.
Rorschach:「I have my own theories. But neither of you seem too concerned.」
narrator:DR. MANHATTAN A live human body and a dead human body have the same number of particles. Structurally there's no difference.
LAURIE:「Well, I might not be able to count molecules, but either way, Blake was a bastard. You know he tried to rape my mother?」
Rorschach:「Sounds like you may have had a score to settle. You or your mother.」

narrator:CONTINUED: --when suddenly Dr. Manhattan materializes in a blue flash, floating in mid-air. The Middle Eastern Men shield their eyes from the light, then realize in awe and fear
 MIDDLE EASTERN MAN (in Arabic) It's him He's, he's real. Allah help us, he's real! The men run for it but it's useless--Dr. Manhattan shoots BEAMS OF ENERGY at them, freezing all the men in mid motion-- --when PORT SECURITY pulls up. They get out of their jeeps, in awe of Dr. Manhattan, still floating in mid-air.
 DR. MANHATTAN These men were transporting a shipment of enriched uranium-- With a gesture, the container floats off the truck and separates into pieces . . revealing the URANIUM inside. Suddenly the uranium changes--
 DR. MANHATTAN I've safely transformed the uranium into sand. I trust you can take things from here. And just like that he disappears--
 INT. LABORATORY - CONTINUOUS
 and is back in the lab without missing a beat.
Rorschach:「I'm not here to judge the moral discrepancies of a man who died in service of his country.」
LAURIE:「You call rape a moral discrepancy?!」
narrator:DR. MANHATTAN Rorschach--you're upsetting Laurie. I think you ought to go.

Rorschach:「I came here to warn you both, just like I warned Adrian and Dan. I believe someone may be targeting masked heroes--」

narrator:CONTINUED:
Rorschach:「It took a lot of effort to get in here. I'm not leaving before I've-- With a look, Dr. Manhattan makes Rorschach disappear.」
narrator:EXT. ROCKEFELLER MILITARY BASE - CONTINUOUS
 Rorschach materializes down the road from the base.
Rorschach:「had my say Rorschach realizes what just happened. Checks himself, his surroundings. Reorients himself. With nothing else he can do, he heads down the road.」

BLAKE:「V.0.) This is all bullshit. Dan, fit and trim in full Nite Owl regalia, attends the meeting of the "new" Watchmen. Rorschach is there, as is a teenage Laurie, dressed in her tight spandex costume. Dr. Manhattan, his age unchanged, stands with his girlfriend JANEY SLATER, though he casts occasional glances at young Laurie . who definitely glances back. Dan also pays Laurie attention, but she is oblivious. A younger Adrian, dressed as Oxymandias, leads the meeting.」
ADRIAN:「What are you saying, Comedian? Blake, now in his forties, smokes a CIGAR, feet on the table, a FLASK in hand. The PAPER in his hand reads: "Arab Leaders Call Dr. Manhattan: 'America's Weapon of Satan."'」
BLAKE:「What I'm saying is this whole bringing back the Watchmen thing is bullshit. It didn't work twenty years ago, and it ain't gonna work just because you want to keep on playing Cowboys and Indians.」
DAN:「Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings. Look, Rorschach and I have made real headway on the gang problem by pooling our efforts. Rorschach's voice is quiet, not yet its tortured rasp.」
Rorschach:「That's true. But something like this seems too big. Too bureaucratic.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
BLAKE:「But it takes a roomful of morons to think they're small enough for you guys to handle. You people are a joke. You hear Moloch's back in town and get your panties in a bunch. You think that matters?」
Rorschach:「Of course it does. Justice matters.」

narrator:CONTINUED: (2)
BLAKE:「Until then, we're society's only protection.」
DAN:「Protection from what? Blake laughs, exultant in the blowing smoke, the chaos.」
BLAKE:「Are you kidding? From themselves. CLOSE ON: the happy face pin on Blake's costume. MATCH CUT TO-」
narrator:EXT. CEMETERY - EVENING
 Dan fingering Blake's happy face pin.
 PRIEST Lord have mercy upon us. Amen. Dan DROPS the pin into Blake's grave. The mourners linger a moment as dirt is shoveled onto Blake's casket, then start filing out. We follow one particular mourner all the way in the back--a LONE MAN, as he walks away.
 EXT. CEMETERY GATES - CONTINUOUS
 The Lone Man leaves quickly.
 INT. MOLOCH'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
 The Lone Man removes his hat and coat. He is old, withered. He is EDGAR JACOBI. In his younger days, he was a supervillain known as MOLOCH--we recognize him from the news clipping in Blake's closet.
 INT. MOLOCH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
 Moloch goes to the REFRIGERATOR, opens it. Then stops, staring. There is a scrawled NOTE inside. Moloch picks it up-- in spiky handwriting it reads: "LOOK BEHIND YOU." Over Moloch's shoulder Rorschach's hat-brim TILTS UP. As Moloch turns, Rorschach lunges, PINS Moloch's ARM behind his back and SLAMS him to the floor.
Rorschach:「Edgar William Jacobi. Also known as Edgar William Vaughn. Also known as William Edgar Bright. Also known as Moloch.」

narrator:CONTINUED: Rorschach TWISTS the man's arm back viciously.
Rorschach:「Lie again, I'll break your arm.」
MOLOCH:「Oh God, please. I did my time. I'm not Moloch anymore. What do you want from me? Rorschach lets him go. Moloch's hollow eyes follow him.」
Rorschach:「You attended a funeral today. Why?」
MOLOCH:「The funeral? I don't know why I went. I just felt I should. I'd been thinking about the Comedian-- Rorschach SLAMS Moloch against the wall.」
Rorschach:「How did you know Blake was the Comedian?」
MOLOCH:「He broke in here! A week ago! He, he had his mask off. He was drunk--」
Rorschach:「You were enemies for forty years. Why would he visit you?」
MOLOCH:「I don't know! I woke up in my bedroom and there he was! He was upset! Crying!」
Rorschach:「The Comedian? Crying?」
MOLOCH:「He, he was babbling, not making sense. I was pissing in my pants--I thought he was going to kill me!」
Rorschach:「What did he say?!」

narrator:CONTINUED: (2)
Rorschach:「Scared of what?!」
MOLOCH:「Something he saw, I think. He said something about wishing he never broke into that building. But that he had to keep his mouth shut. Then, then he left! Rorschach studies Moloch a moment, then releases him.」
Rorschach:「Hm. Funny story. Sounds unbelievable. Probably true. Rorschach glances around the kitchen. He opens some drawers, looking inside. He picks up a stack of MAIL, flips through it. One of the envelopes contains a PENSION CHECK from "Pyramid Industries."」
MOLOCH:「So that's it? I'm clean?」
Rorschach:「Clean? I searched your house. Found illegal drugs.」
MOLOCH:「Illegal--I don't use drugs. Rorschach pulls a PILL BOTTLE from his coat.」
Rorschach:「Laetril. Phony medication made from apricot pits. Illegal.」
MOLOCH:「oh c-come on. Look, please don't confiscate that. I'm trying anything . I have cancer.」
Rorschach:「What kind of cancer?」
MOLOCH:「The kind you don't get better from.」

Rorschach:「Fine. You're off the hook, for now. If you remember anything else, leave me a note in the trash can opposite the Gunga Diner at Fortieth and Seventh. Keep out of trouble, Moloch.」

narrator:EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT
 CLOSE ON: Rorschach blasting through the night air as the city streams by. This close, he appears to be flying.
Rorschach:「V.0.) Rorschach's Journal, October 17th. Thought about Moloch's story on my way to the cemetery. Could all be lies. A scheme for revenge planned during his years behind bars. CUT WIDE: To reveal he is actually PERCHED ATOP AN ELEVATED SUBWAY CAR. Just one way he gets around.
 V.0.) But if it's true, then what? What could have possibly scared the Comedian? What building was he talking about? What was it that he saw? So many questions.」
narrator:EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT
 Rorschach stands alone over Blake's fresh grave. Paying his proper respects.

Rorschach:「V.0.) Edward Blake--the Comedian. Born 1944, buried in the rain. Murdered. FLASH TO: Blake, the night of his murder, turning as his door is kicked in.
 V.0.) Violent lives ending violently. FLASH TO: Adrian's display burning.
 V.0.) Blake understood. Humans are violent in nature. No matter how much you try to dress it up, to disguise it. FLASHES OF: The group photo of the old Watchmen. Then the photo of the new Watchmen.
 V.0.) Blake saw the true face of human kind and chose to become a parody of it, treated it like a joke. FLASHES OF: Blake being beaten in his apartment.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
Rorschach:「V.0.) I heard a joke once. Man goes to a doctor, says he's depressed. Life seems harsh and cruel. Blake is KICKED in the stomach.
 V.0.) Says he feels all alone in a threatening world. Blake stands alone in the blowing tear gas smoke.
 V.0.) Doctor says, "the treatment is simple. The great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up." Blake is lifted up by the Intruder's hands.
 V.0.) The man bursts into tears. A bloodied Blake laughs at the Intruder.
 V.0.) "But doctor," he says. ULTRA-SLOW, Blake crashes through his apartment window.
 "I am Pagliacci." Blake FLIES TOWARD FRAME on his silent trip to the ground.
 V.0.) Good joke. Everybody laugh. Blake FALLS INTO FRAME--GO BLACK .」

narrator:CONTINUED:
LAURIE:「Only one thing can bring ion back and that's Jon. If he wants to find me, he's quite capable of doing so on his own. I've been a prisoner in my live long enough. You are taking me out of here because if you don't, and Jon does come back, I'm going to let him know who was naughty and who was nice. And he won't give you a lump of coal--he'll turn you into one, understand? The Agent eyes her, then reluctantly gets to his feet.」
narrator:INT. DAN DREIBERG'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN
 Dan sleeps peacefully in his bed when a SHADOW moves over Dan . dropping a NEWSPAPER on his LAP, waking Dan with a gasp. Rorschach hovers beside the bed.
DAN:「Jesus! Rorschach」
Rorschach:「Good morning, Daniel. I brought in your paper. Dan reads the headline: "DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH."
 The Comedian murdered. Dr. Manhattan exiled. Two of us gone within a week. Who's next? Veidt? Ms. Jupiter? Me? You? Rorschach turns for the door as Dan reads the story.
 By the way, that new lock broke after one shove.」
DAN:「My new lock?」

Rorschach:「Get a stronger one, Daniel. You can't be too security conscious these days.」
narrator:START WORLD MONTAGE:
Rorschach:「V.0.) These days nobody's safe. We see the same Pakistani Soldiers from before, only now there are dozens more TROOPS with them, mobilizing on the border as are their Indian counterparts--」

narrator:CONTINUED: Rorschach investigates the apartment of ROY CHESS, Adrian's would-be assassin. The place is decent but messy. Rorschach spots a PORNO MAG on the coffee table. On the couch nearby, a pair of PANTS. Rorschach picks them up, reaches into the pockets. He pulls out some cash, credit cards-- --and an ID for Pyramid Industries. It says Chess was a security guard . and then Rorschach remembers the pension check he saw at Moloch's house. From Pyramid Industries. Rorschach sees a LAPTOP over on the kitchen table. The computer is on and shows the SERVER for Pyramid Industries. Rorschach navigates the server until he finds the EMPLOYEE
 DIRECTORY. Once in the directory he pauses for a second. Then he types in a name: "Jane Slater." A photo of Janey Slater pops up--"Status: RETIRED." Rorschach stares at the screen, excited at the connection.
 EXT. STREET - NIGHT
 We're in Rorschach's POV as he walks down the street. From the non-reaction of passers by, he obviously doesn't have his mask on.
Rorschach:「V.O.) Rorschach's Journal, October 19th. Someone tried to kill Adrian Veidt. Proves mask killer theory--the murderer is closing in. Pyramid Industries is the key. Rorschach approaches a TRASH CAN. He rummages through it and finds an ENVELOPE. He opens it and finds a NOTE that reads: "Tonight 11:30, M."
 V.O.) Checked mail drop, got a message from Moloch. Was just going to pay him a visit. Rorschach turns down an alley, approaches a DUMPSTER. He reaches behind the dumpster.
 V.0.) My things are where I left them. My coat. My gloves」

narrator:CONTINUED: Still in his POV, we watch him put each article on. Then he pulls out his MASK.
Rorschach:「V.0.) . my face. Rorschach pulls his mask on, FILLING THE SCREEN」
narrator:INT. MOLOCH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
 CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S EYES staring fearfully out the rainy window. Rorschach APPEARS in the darkness behind him.

Rorschach:「Somebody tried to shoot the world's smartest man today, Moloch. Moloch sits at the kitchen table. CLOSE ON: MOLOCH'S HAND. An ignored CIGARETTE smolders. In his other hand, a NOTE.
 The hitman worked for Pyramid Industries. So did Janey Slater and everyone else Dr. Manhattan allegedly gave cancer to. And last time I was here, I saw a pension check sent to you from the same company-- obviously a front set up by whoever it is that killed the Comedian, that pushed Dr. Manhattan over the edge, that wants us masks dead. Is that why you left me a note in my mail drop? You have something to confess? Rorschach turns. A HOLE gapes between Moloch's staring eyes. A PISTOL lies on the table--Moloch's dead. Rorschach carefully pulls the NOTE from Moloch's hand. It's the note Rorschach had left in Moloch's refrigerator, the one that reads: "LOOK BEHIND YOU." Behind Rorschach, BLINDING LIGHT GLARES THROUGH THE WINDOW.」
narrator:DET. FINE (O.S.) (over LOUDSPEAKERS)
 RORSCHACH, THIS IS THE POLICE!
Rorschach:「No.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
Rorschach:「No. No, no, no」
narrator:DET. FINE (O.S.)
 IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THERE WITH YOU, SEND
 THEM OUT UNHARMED. Moloch's corpse stares at Rorschach. Rorschach TEARS OPEN the cupboards, pulling items off the shelves.
Rorschach:「Framed. Set up. Walked right into it. Stupid, stupid, stupid.」
narrator:DET. FINE (O.S.)
 LET'S MAKE THIS A NICE, CLEAN SURRENDER.
Rorschach:「Heh. Never. Never surrender. Rorschach takes an AEROSOL CAN and a PEPPER SHAKER.」
narrator:DET. FINE (O.S.)
 ALRIGHT. I HOPE YOU'RE READY, "HERO." Rorschach's mask DISAPPEARS back into darkness.
Rorschach:「When you are」

narrator:CONTINUED: But Rorschach holds up a gloved hand. And they all stop, unsure what this lunatic will do next.
Rorschach:「Ten years. I've waited for this. He beckons them forward. The cops PILE INTO HIM. Rorschach brutally disables six cops before he is overwhelmed.
 No pain. Must get up. Find who framed me-- A Cop KICKS HIM in the throat. Rorschach drops again.」
narrator:FINE Get that mask off him!
 COP 1 I got it. Christ, he stinks!
Rorschach:「No no no NO NO NO! The Cop peels back the shifting mask to reveal the Homeless Man from the news stand. He screams at them wildly.
 My face! Give it back to me! Rorschach is finally beaten, surrounded by cops, as Moloch's house blazes in the background.」

narrator:CONTINUED: (2)
LAURIE:「He shot a cop with a grappling gun.」
DAN:「Don't remind me, I made that thing for him. But a regular gun just seems too . ordinary」
LAURIE:「And this war, god. Sometimes I wish I could just leave the planet. Like Jon.」
DAN:「Oh sure. The old Manhattan Transfer.」
LAURIE:「Now, that's funny. That's what you call Jon's teleportation?」
DAN:「Well, not to his face. Laurie laughs.」
narrator:INT. PRISON HALLS - DAY
 Rorschach walks, led by TWO CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. From the cells, PRISONERS shout insults, death threats. Rorschach stares ahead. Silent. Calm.
 INT. PRISON PSYCH ROOM - DAY
 The PRISON PSYCHIATRIST, Black, amiable, a mite portly, sits across the table from Rorschach sans mask: Cold and frightening. The Psychiatrist reads his FILE.
PSYCHIATRIST:「Walter Kovacs. Is that your name? Walter?」
Rorschach:「No. The Psychiatrist sits back, considering Rorschach carefully.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
Rorschach:「A prison is a prison.」
PSYCHIATRIST:「Yes, but the difference is, downstairs? They'll eat you alive. He holds up a RORSCHACH BLOT-CARD.
 Now . . tell me what you see. FLASH OF: A DEAD DOG. Bloody, horrible.」
Rorschach:「A pretty butterfly. The Psychiatrist holds up another blot-card.」
PSYCHIATRIST:「How about this one? What do you see here? FLASH OF: Rorschach, as a LITTLE BOY, watching his MOTHER, HALF NAKED, EMBRACE A MAN AS HE HANDS HER SOME MONEY. When she catches Rorschach interrupting, she SMACKS him in the face. Shuts the door on him.」
Rorschach:「Some nice flowers. The Psychiatrist eyes him, dubious. Holds up another card. FLASH OF: Rorschach as a little boy looking up at TWO OLDER BOYS, teasing him. Calling him "son of a whore." Rorschach just wants to be left alone when one of the Boys SPITS in his face. Suddenly, Rorschach's face changes. He attacks the Boy like a wild animal--biting, clawing .
 Clouds. The Psychiatrist sighs, puts the cards down.」

PSYCHIATRIST:「Tell me about Rorschach. Will you do that?」
Rorschach:「Why are you here with me, doctor?」

narrator:CONTINUED: (2)
Rorschach:「There's other men in here with behavior more extreme than mine. Of course, they're not famous. You want to know about Rorschach, doctor? I'll tell you about Rorschach」
narrator:EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
 Rorschach, walks through intermittent STREETLIGHTS. In his GLOVE, he holds a PHOTO of an angelic SIX YEAR OLD GIRL.
Rorschach:「V.0.) I was investigating a kidnap case. Blair Roche, 6 year old girl. I was young then. Too soft on criminals. I let them live.」
narrator:EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
 A creepy, deserted-looking house. Rorschach peers through a slatted fence at TWO GERMAN SHEPHERDS FIGHTING.
Rorschach:「V.0.) Broke a man's arm to get a tip. Led me to the missing girl's location.」

narrator:INT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
 CRACK! The front door is KICKED OPEN, smashing the lock. Rorschach moves between a line of headless MANNEQUINS. In one corner rests an old WOOD-BURNING STOVE. Rorschach peers inside, removes a BLACKENED scrap of UNDERWEAR. It's decorated with little hearts and bears.
Rorschach:「V.0.) I knew the girl was here. But when I searched the place I found nothing.」
narrator:INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
 Rorschach enters the kitchen. Out the window, the DOGS are fighting. Rorschach opens a cupboard, where a line of KNIVES, CLEAVERS and a HACKSAW hang on hooks. Outside, the snarling dogs get LOUDER. Slowly now, Rorschach's gaze moves from the knives . to the counter. He runs his gloved finger along RED STAINED, DEEP-CUT GROOVES in a THICK WOODEN CHOPPING BLOCK. Blood. His gaze continues out the window
Rorschach:「V.0.) And then I found her.」

narrator:CONTINUED: . to the dogs, still fighting over the BONE, which we now recognize as a small, HUMAN FEMUR--that of the little girl. Rorschach clenches his hands in fury, his fists tremble and suddenly, he relaxes. Calms. Rorschach slowly turns to the cupboard. He reaches for a large CLEAVER .
 EXT. HOUSE - LATER (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
 The CHILD MOLESTER, greasy and fat, walks past the now-silent fence.
Rorschach:「V.0.) It was dark when the murderer got back. As dark as it gets.」

narrator:INT. HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
 The Man flicks a LIGHT SWITCH. Nothing. He draws a GUN.
 INT. HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK - 13 YEARS AGO)
 He tries the light in here. Nothing again. He turns away as the BODY of a DEAD GERMAN SHEPARD CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW! He SCRAMBLES through the warehouse, falling over mannequins. He FIRES madly into the dark. The SECOND DOG SMASHES INTO HIM FROM A SECOND WINDOW. His gun goes flying. He scrambles backward against the stove. FROM BEHIND, Rorschach CUFFS THE MAN'S WRIST TO THE STOVE. When the Child Molester sees that "face," he loses his bladder. Rorschach just stares, mask-blots shifting
 CHILD MOLESTER You think I had something to do with that girl? I didn't! Where's your evidence? Rorschach calmly points to body of the dog. (It is the same image Rorschach saw in the first blot-card.)
 CHILD MOLESTER Okay, I confess! I kidnapped her! I killed her! Arrest me!
Rorschach:「Men get arrested. Rorschach RAISES THE CLEAVER, high over his head」

narrator:CONTINUED: RORSCHACH Dogs get put down. Rorschach SWINGS the cleaver DOWN. Blood SPATTERS his mask.
 INT. PRISON PSYCH ROOM - DAY
 The Psychiatrist listens, paralyzed. Horrified.
Rorschach:「A tremor of impact shook my arm. Warm blood splashed my face. It was Walter Kovacs who screamed, who closed his eyes-- it was Rorschach who opened them again. The silence reels out RORSCHACH You see, Doctor. God didn't kill that little girl, fate didn't butcher her and destiny didn't feed her to those dogs. If God saw what any of us did that night, he didn't seem to mind. From then on, I knew. God doesn't make the world this way. We do. The Psychiatrist rises shakily. He crosses to the GUARD.」

narrator:CONTINUED: Rorschach doesn't register this. He waits for the FRY-COOK behind the counter to turn away-- --then casually reaches across and lifts the DEEP-FRYER BASKET from its mount-- --the Prisoner JABS the shiv forward--Rorschach spins, GRIPPING the man's wrist and FLINGING the BOILING GREASE INTO THE MAN'S FACE. The man SHRIEKS like a FIRE WHISTLE and CRASHES TO THE GROUND. The Guards DESCEND on Rorschach. Rorschach is calm as he's dragged away. As the injured man's screams fall away to weak, bubbling hitches, the room once again goes silent. Rorschach eyes the fearful, hateful eyes of the room, marking each one. And in the silence he speaks, his icy voice carrying easily.
Rorschach:「None of you understand. I'm not locked up in here with you. Rorschach is placidly dragged off INTO DARKNESS
 You're locked up in here with me.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
Rorschach:「Big Figure. Small world.」
BIG FIGURE:「chuckles through smoke) I like that. But you know, it is a small world in here. I've been in it for--how long now, Billy?」
narrator:DUMB THUG Twenty years, Mr. Figure.
BIG FIGURE:「That's right. Twenty years since you and that owl fella put me away. Rorschach-- that guy you burned is dying. Could go any minute now. And when he does, this place is gonna explode. Then you die by inches.」
Rorschach:「Tall order.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
LAURIE:「V.0.) What?」
narrator:INT. PRISON MEDICAL ROOM - NIGHT
 The Prisoner Rorschach burned lies in bed, his face completely bandaged, hooked to an IV . . when he FLATLINES.
 INT. RORSCHACH'S PRISON CELL - NIGHT
 Down the dark corridors, a ROAR is building. ALARMS ring. Big Figure and his two Thugs appear at the door.
BIG FIGURE:「He's dead, Rorschach--the riot's already begun. While everyone's distracted, we thought we'd bring you a housewarming gift. Something from the machine shop. The Fat Thug wheels an ELECTRICAL WELDER to the door. Rorschach sits, idly TEARING his PRISON SHIRT into STRIPS.」
narrator:FAT THUG Hey Boss, y'notice? None of that "small world, tall order" crap, cuz he knows once we slice open this lock, he's next on the block.
Rorschach:「Fat chance. The Fat Thug reddens. He DIVES forward, HANDS SWIPING for Rorschach.」

narrator:FAT THUG You're dead, Rorschach! We got a prison full of killers out here! What've you got? Rorschach SPINS, WRAPPING A SHIRT-STRIP AROUND HIS WRISTS, trapping the Fat Thug's hands inside the cell.
Rorschach:「Your hands. My pleasure. Rorschach SNAPS Fat Thug's pinky fingers. Fat Thug SHRIEKS. Rorschach roughly binds the fingers around the bars. Dumb Thug tries to reach the welder around Fat Thug's body.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
BIG FIGURE:「This riot won't last. And I've been waiting twenty years for this Big Figure nods to the Dumb Thug, who then grabs Fat Thug's neck.」
narrator:DUMB THUG Nothing personal, big guy.
 FAT THUG Boss, you can't be serious! Wait-- Dumb Thug SNAPS Fat Thug's neck. He then CUTS OFF Fat Thug's hands with the welder, pushes the corpse out of the way to reach the lock. Big Figure grins at Rorschach.
BIG FIGURE:「Now you find out what the score is.」
Rorschach:「One-nothing. Come and get me.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
Rorschach:「Hmm. Never disposed of sewage with a toilet before. Obvious, really. Big Figure looks very small and alone now
 Two-nothing. Your move. Panic stricken, Big Figure moves, or rather, runs. Rorschach calmly follows him out of the cell.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
DAN:「He's alive.」
narrator:INT. PRISON HALLS - NIGHT
 Big Figure runs, turns a corner, ducking into the BATHROOM. Rorschach sees this and walks serenely after him . when Dan and Laurie enter the far hall.
LAURIE:「Is that--」
DAN:「Rorschach? Rorschach!」
Rorschach:「Hello, Daniel, Ms. Jupiter. Excuse me, I just have to visit the men's room. He disappears into the dark bathroom. Laurie watches after him in stunned disbelief.」
LAURIE:「Oh, for Christ's sake.」
DAN:「Hey, it happens. I remember I lost a big arrest like that once. Had to redesign the costume after that-- Rorschach exits the bathroom, wiping his hands.」
Rorschach:「We can leave now. He walks off.」
LAURIE:「Are you sure you're ready? We don't want to go diving head-first into things.」
Rorschach:「Good Advice. I'm sure there are many who'd agree with you. Behind them: BLOODY WATER FLOODS from the bathroom door as they go.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
Rorschach:「Good to see you in uniform, Daniel. What happened? Finally taking the mask-killer seriously?」
LAURIE:「I'm not.」
Rorschach:「Of course you haven't been attacked yet. Funny, most everyone else has.」
LAURIE:「What's that supposed to mean? We came here to rescue you, asshole!」
DAN:「Hey! Survive now! Argue later! I had to turn the screechers off, so we'll be drawing fire. The owl-Ship rises to the roof. They all jump in.」
narrator:EXT. PRISON - NIGHT
 Under HEAVY FIRE the Owl-Ship ZOOMS OFF, leaving the chaos behind.
 INT. OWL-SHIP (MOVING) NIGHT
 Dan weaves and whips the ship into the sky, above the clouds. Satisfied that they've escaped, Dan allows himself a grin. He looks at Laurie, who grins back.
DAN:「Rorschach, you remember how to handle Archie?」
Rorschach:「I believe so. Rorschach sits in the pilot's seat. Dan turns to Laurie, high on adrenaline and love. Dan moves in to kiss her--
 Daniel.」
DAN:「Give us a second--」

Rorschach:「I don't think this can wait.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
DAN:「What? What is it Dan looks up, through the windshield, and sees-- --Dr. Manhattan WALKING ACROSS THE CLOUDS--STRAIGHT FOR THE」
narrator:SHIP.
LAURIE:「It `s him. The ship COLLIDES with Dr. Manhattan, who PASSES THROUGH into the CABIN with a SHOWER of BLUE PARTICLES--」
narrator:DR. MANHATTAN Hello Laurie.
LAURIE:「They said you were on Mars.」
narrator:DR. MANHATTAN I am on Mars. You and I are about to have a conversation there.
LAURIE:「Where? What are you talking about?」
narrator:DR. MANHATTAN You are going to try to convince me to save the world.
DAN:「Wait, what? You're taking her to Mars? No, she can't--Laurie, I don't know about」
narrator:THIS Laurie looks at Dan then at Dr. Manhattan. Comprehending
LAURIE:「I have to go, Dan. Jon and I, we're going to talk. Maybe we'll find some way out of this mess the world's gotten itself in. I'll be okay. Really.」
narrator:DAN
 LAURIE-- Laurie and Dr. Manhattan BURST INTO PARTICLES--they're gone. Dan stares at the space where Laurie just was.
Rorschach:「No time for heartbreak, Daniel.」

narrator:CONTINUED: --and heads straight for a SUBWAY TUNNEL
 INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
 just clearing it. The Owl-Ship SKIMS the sides of the tunnel, SPARKS flying-- --when a SUBWAY appears. They're heading straight for it.
DAN:「oh no.」
Rorschach:「Tactical error, Daniel.」

narrator:CONTINUED: In his SLO-MO world, Hollis PASTES at Villain in the mouth-- in reality, he gets nailed. This intercutting continues until the Gang Leader picks up the GOLD STATUE of Hollis in costume whose base reads: IN GRATITUDE
 GANG MEMBER 1 Hold on, Derf, are you sure this is the right guy--he, he's just an old man.
GANG LEADER:「Then I'm probably doing him a favor. Hollis, old again, looks up. The SHADOW of the statue」
narrator:DESCENDS HARD TOWARD HIS FACE--GO BLACK.
 INT. OWL-SHIP (UNDERWATER - MOVING) - NIGHT
 The Owl-Ship moves slowly through the water.
Rorschach:「I hate this. How long are we going to stay down here? Daniel! Dan says nothing. Rorschach puts on his costume.
 You're letting fear paralyze you. And that woman--」
DAN:「Hey! We took enough unnecessary risks bringing Archie up so you could get your spare costume. We stay put until it cools down out there--they're looking for us.」

Rorschach:「Unnecessary? Cowering in the sludge, from the authorities, that's unnecessary. Rorschach pulls his mask on, turns.
 While we waste time, the mask-killer gets closer. We need to get to Pyramid Industries. Dan sits at the COMPUTER.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
Rorschach:「Sitting at a computer? No. We need to trace the killer--hit up underworld contacts, squeeze people. You've forgotten how we do things. You've been lazing around too long.」
DAN:「Listen, I HAVE HAD IT! Who the hell do you think you are? You live off people while insulting them, and no one complains because they think you're a goddamn lunatic! Dan turns away, shaking. He leans against the console.
 I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Maybe you're right, maybe--」
narrator:RORSCHACH
 DANIEL Dan turns. Rorschach holds out an open hand.
Rorschach:「You are a good friend. I'm sorry that it is sometimes difficult with me. Touched, Dan shakes his hand. An awkward, lovely moment.」

narrator:CONTINUED: (2)
LAURIE:「That's ridiculous. The Earth is too important to hinge on one relationship.」
narrator:DR. MANHATTAN Not to me. My red world here means more to me than your blue one. I'll show you around if you like. The giant Glass Palace begins to RUMBLE.
LAURIE:「Are you doing this? I'm not in the mood for jokes.」
narrator:DR. MANHATTAN Nor I. Believe me, I fully understand the gravity of the situation. The clockwork Glass Palace RISES HIGH INTO THE AIR
 EXT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - NIGHT
 The Owl-Ship approaches the large warehouse building that is Pyramid Industries. The ship lands in the alley nearby. Dan and Rorschach exit the ship. Shady neighborhood. Rorschach goes to the door which is AJAR
 INT. PYRAMID INDUSTRIES - HALLWAY - NIGHT
 Dan and Rorschach slowly make their way down, peering into ROOMS. The place looks abandoned--scattered papers, dusty file cabinets, leftover computer components
Rorschach:「You sure this is the correct location, Daniel?」

narrator:CONTINUED:
DAN:「I tapped into all the databases--tax records, business registries, real estate records--trying to get a bead on who's behind Pyramid but it's a never ending paper trail. Rorschach investigates ahead when Dan catches some MOVEMENT-- --he turns his FLASHLIGHT to find a few HOMELESS PEOPLE squatting in the warehouse. Upon seeing Dan in.costume, the Homeless People run away.」
Rorschach:「Daniel.」
DAN:「They're harmless, Rorschach.」
Rorschach:「Daniel. Rorschach is looking down at something. Dan heads over and sees a DEAD BODY in the early stages of decomposition. He turns the body over--bullet between the eyes just like Moloch . but we recognize the corpse--it's journalist Doug Roth.」
DAN:「Hey, I know this man.」
Rorschach:「Yes. Doug Roth. Journalist who grilled Dr. Manhattan on national television.」
DAN:「No I didn't watch that interview. This was the guy who was doing a story on Adrian when I went to see him.」

Rorschach:「Hmm. Journalist set up Dr. Manhattan, was probably working to set up Veidt also. Dan stands there thinking. As if hit with an epiphany. He opens his mouth like he can't believe what he's going to say.」
DAN:「Rorschach. What, what if it's Adrian?」
Rorschach:「Veidt? Behind everything? Makes no sense.」

narrator:CONTINUED: ( 2)
DAN:「On the surface it doesn't, but hear me out--Adrian's the only one who could've taken on the Comedian in hand to hand combat. He's the only one with the finances to create an entire company for the sole purpose of setting up Dr. Manhattan. And Adrian was directly involved in arranging that broadcast. He probably supplied this journalist with the whole cancer list.」
Rorschach:「That doesn't explain the attempt on Veidt's life.」
DAN:「If we say that Adrian set that up himself, he could've had the hitman shoot his assistant first. It was a risk, but--」
Rorschach:「But why?」

narrator:CONTINUED: --and sees Dan gripping the bloody Gang Leader by the THROAT, CHOKING him as the other Gang Members flee.
DAN:「You're dead! You and the rest of your gang, you're all DEAD! You know how much fire-power I've got floating out there!? Oh god damn. Hollis. God damn god damn god damn Dan begins to break up. Rorschach quietly pulls him away.」
Rorschach:「Not now, Daniel.」
narrator:EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING
 The Owl-Ship slows to a hover besides an OLDER BUILDING.

Rorschach:「V.0.) Rorschach's Journal. Final entry? Dreiberg is convinced that Veidt is behind everything. Apparently, the Owl- Ship is capable of the trip to Antarctica, but are we? I cannot imagine a more dangerous opponent. Veldt is faster than Dreiberg and myself. He used to joke that he was fast enough to catch a bullet. I believe he could. He could kill us both, alone in' the snow. No one would know. Rorschach descends the ladder, goes to the door of the building. He places his JOURNAL in an ENVELOPE.
 V.0.) I have done my best to make this legible. Whether I am alive or dead upon this reading, know that whatever the nature of this conspiracy--Adrian Veldt is responsible. He drops the envelope into the MAIL SLOT, climbs back up the ladder.
 V.0.) I appreciate your recent support and hope the world survives long enough for this to reach you. For my own part, I regret nothing. I have lived my life free of compromise, and step now into the shadow without complaint. Rorschach. October 21st.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
DAN:「I've got a large reading ahead. Anything that's emitting that much heat out here, must be a pretty big facility. Adrian.」
narrator:BEAT) We're not going to make it, are we? Rorschach says nothing . when a halting WHINE sputters from the engines. A HUGE CLIFF APPEARS before them.
Rorschach:「The engines--」
DAN:「They're icing up, hold on! Dan pulls the stick back. The ship SHUDDERS UPWARD.」
narrator:EXT. ANTARCTICA - DAWN
 The ship, tiny before the massive ice-wall, climbs slowly. It's going to be close. The wall is 100 yards away now, the top-most edge barely in view. 50 yards. 20 and then
 SILENCE--
DAN:「We just lost the engines--find something to grab on to! The ship BARELY CLEARS THE CLIFF. BOUNCING hard, it SKIPS across the snow like a stone, finally CRASHING INTO A DRIFT.」
narrator:INT. OWL-SHIP - DAWN
 Dan opens the hatch. Shrieking WIND blows the snow in. Dan pulls on a white, FUR-LINED SNOW-OWL costume.

DAN:「The engines are de-icing. You sure I can't fit you with something warmer?」
Rorschach:「Fine like this.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
ADRIAN:「Really, getting even this far is an admirable effort, given their limitations. Of course the ice they're skating on is slippery and thinner than it looks. Let's hope they don't overstep themselves. On the monitors, Dan takes a LASER TORCH to the door.
 Let's hope they know when to stop.」
narrator:INT. KARNAK - DAWN
 Having burnt through the control panel, Dan pushes the huge door open. They enter the grand palace, dwarfed by its Macedonian massiveness.
 DAN
 JESUS
 BEAT) I don't understand any of this. Adrian's a pacifist. He's never killed anyone in his life. He's a vegetarian for Christ's sake!
Rorschach:「Hitler was a vegetarian. If you're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get a second chance.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
ADRIAN:「Paris, Tehran, Kashmir, Beijing, Taiwan, Pyongyang, London, Jerusalem, New York-- destroying approximately three million people.」
DAN:「Three million people? You're joking.」
Rorschach:「He's not. Listen to his voice.」

narrator:CONTINUED:
Rorschach:「Impersonated Dr. Manhattan. Murdered millions of people. (re: Lynx) Call off your cat. Call off your cat and face me!」

narrator:CONTINUED:
 DR. MANHATTAN I'm sorry. It's these tachyons. They're, muddling things up. I'd better follow him
 INSIDE In a burst, he's gone.
 INT. KARNAK - CONTROL HALL - CONTINUOUS
 Jon materializes in the hall. Adrian sprints like lightening, out of the room, followed by the Lynx.
Rorschach:「No, don't let him escape!」

narrator:CONTINUED:
ADRIAN:「No? Will you expose me, undoing the peace so many have just died for? Morally, you're in checkmate, just like the Comedian was. Jon examines the many screens, taking it all in.」
narrator:DR. MANHATTAN I'm afraid he's correct. Exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.
DAN:「He's right. All we did was fail to stop him from saving Earth.」
LAURIE:「We we can't say anything about this」
narrator:
Rorschach:「You're joking, of course. Rorschach walks toward the exit.」
DAN:「Rorschach, wait a second! Let's talk this out!」
Rorschach:「Never. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise. Adrian and Jon's eyes meet--an unspoken communication. Seeing this, Dan runs after Rorschach.」
DAN:「Rorschach! Across the hall, ion materializes between Rorschach and the exit.」
narrator:DR. MANHATTAN Where are you going, Rorschach?
Rorschach:「Back to the Owl-Ship. Back to America. People must be told. Evil must be punished.」

narrator:CONTINUED: (2)
 DR. MANHATTAN Rorschach, you know I can't let you do that. Rorschach pauses. Dan is halfway there . Rorschach removes his mask, tears stand in his eyes.
Rorschach:「Suddenly you've rediscovered humanity? If you had cared from the start, none of this would be necessary. None of this would have happened. So what are you waiting for? Do it.」
