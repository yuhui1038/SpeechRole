 EXT.	A STILL FRAME OF A DENTON CATHOLIC CHURCH	DAY
 CHORUS (Cont) To the late night double feature Picture Show.
 The SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the IMAGE EXPANDS TO WIDE-SCREEN. The STILL FRAME bursts to life as the doors of the Denton Catholic Church are flung open and Mendelssohn's wedding march resounds from the church organ.
 The young married couple, RALPH and BETTY HAPSCHATT appear followed by a crowd of friends and well-wishers throwing confetti and shouting excitedly.
 The MINISTER shakes RALPH by the hand while RALPH slips him a $20 bill.
 PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures.
 BRAD MAJORS, a young slightly awkward, clean-cut American in his mid- twenties, comes over the congratulate RALPH. BRAD and RALPH shake hands.
 RALPH Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!
BRAD:「Well I don't think there was any doubt about that - You and Betty have been almost inseparable ever since you sat in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.」
narrator:RALPH Tell you the truth Brad, she was the only reason I came in the first place. Science was never one of my favourite subjects but I sure with Dr Scott could have made it today.
BRAD:「Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him. We drove over to see him last vacation. It's a shame his new job took him away from Denton.」
narrator:BETTY, the bride, throws the bouquet.
 JANET catches it. She squeals with delight.
 The GUESTS cheer.
 RALPH Hey fella. It looks like it could be your turn next.
BRAD:「Who knows...ha ha.」
narrator:RALPH &amp; BETTY drive off. GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD &amp; JANET with great enthusiasm. GUESTS begin to disperse.
 JANET &amp; BRAD linger outside the church. So do a strange FAMILY : An old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter. They resemble the Quaker family in "American Gothic", a painting.
 The MOTHER (MAGENTA) and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church doors. Their DAUGHTER (COLUMBIA) goes inside. The FAMILY, and the MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the GUESTS all resemble characters we shall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place.

JANET:「who is holding the bouquet) Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't Betty look radiantly beautiful.
 Just an hour ago she was plain old Betty Monroe. Now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapschatt.」
BRAD:「Still looking after the car) Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a lucky guy. (They start to move d.s.)」
JANET:「Yes.」
BRAD:「Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.」
JANET:「Yes.」
BRAD:「And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.」
JANET:「Yes.」

narrator:CHURCH BELLS Peal out. RIFF &amp; MAGENTA open doors and solemnly enter the church, door closes behind them.

 INT.	A STUDY	NIGHT
 Mahogany bookcases, a large desk with a prominent globe of the world. A well-padded armchair has its back to the camera. It swings around revealing the NARRATOR. He is in his smoking jacket. He speaks directly to us.
NARRATOR:I would like if I may to take you on a strange journey.
narrator:He crosses to the bookshelf. He selects a dossier. We see the title: "The Denton Affair". He returns to his desk and places it on a bookstand. He puts on his reading glasses.
NARRATOR:It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss (two young ordinary healthy kids) left Denton that late November evening to visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and now friend of both of them. It's true there were dark storm clouds, heavy, black and pendulous, toward which they were driving. It's true also that the spare tyre they were carrying was badly in need of some air. But they being normal kids and on a night out, well they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening.
narrator:On a night out.
 He closes the book marking the place.
 Thunder is heard distantly on the sound track.
NARRATOR:It was a night out they were going to remember for a very long time.
narrator:Lighting cracks on the sound track.

 A windscreen wiper working under strain. Torrential rain on the windscreen. BRAD concentrating on visibility. JANET eating chocolates and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The Shadow.
 A motorcycle roars past them.

BRAD:「Yes, Janet. Life's pretty cheap to that type.」
narrator:JANET takes another stick of gum.
 Offers BRAD some. He declines.
 The car slows to a halt.
JANET:「What's the matter Brad, darling?」
narrator:Headlights on sign reading: "DEAD END".
BRAD:「I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.」
JANET:「Oh dear! But then where did the motorcyclists come from?」

narrator:He unbuckles his seatbelt.
JANET:「I'm coming with you.」
BRAD:「There's no point both of us getting wet.」
JANET:「I'm coming with you. (she unbuckles her seatbelt) Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.」

 She sing plaintively.
JANET:「In the velvet darkness Of the blackest night Burning bright.」
narrator:We see the two of them - BRAD striding ahead, JANET nearly catching up with him.
 Behind them on the side of the road, sparse trees and rock formations.
JANET:「There's a guiding star No matter what or who you are.」
narrator:They have passed a row of trees. A rock formation in the shape of a castle is silhouetted against the sky. It has a flag flying from the turret.
 Lightning strikes.
 A glow of light appears in a window. It illuminates a path to the castle.
 BRAD and JANET turn.
 The castle is in the distance between the two of them.
BRAD &amp; JANET:「There's a light」

 BRAD rings the doorbell. It makes a strange sound.
JANET:「Oh, Brad. Let's go back. I'm cold and I'm frightened.」
BRAD:「Just a moment, Janet. They may have a telephone.」
narrator:The door opens. Throbbing music is heard in the background as if there is a party going on in the distance.
 The figure we have seen at the window emerges. He is a hunch-backed servant, RIFF RAFF.
RIFF RAFF:「Hello.」
BRAD:「Uh - oh - Hi! My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss. I - ah - wondered if you could help us. Our car has broken down about two miles up the road. Do you have a phone we might use?」

 They arrive at a hallway at the bottom of the stairs. Another servant, MAGENTA, who bears a striking physical resemblance to RIFF RAFF is vacuuming the stairs.
RIFF RAFF:「This way.」

JANET:「Are you - giving a party?」
RIFF RAFF:「No. You've arrived on a rather special night. It's one of the master's affairs.」
JANET:「Oh, lucky him.」
MAGENTA:「He's lucky.」
narrator:BRAD and JANET look at MAGENTA, surprised by her voice.
MAGENTA:「You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all lucky.」
narrator:SONG:
 "THE TIME WARP"
 BRAD and JANET are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic.
 They look back to RIFF RAFF. He is now standing by a set of mirrors reflecting to infinity.
RIFF RAFF:「It's astounding Time is fleeting Madness takes its toll But listen closely Not for very much longer I've got to keep control.」
narrator:MAGENTA gives RIFF RAFF a strange signal.
 RIFF RAFF starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion.
RIFF RAFF:「I remember doing the Time Warp.」
narrator:BRAD and JANET are amazed.
RIFF RAFF:「Drinking those moments when The blackness would hit me.」
narrator:MAGENTA half closes her eyes in pleasure.
 JANET clings to BRAD.
RIFF RAFF:「And the void would be calling.」

 INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT
 BRAD and JANET find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver ballroom. At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding it, a theatre proscenium. In the body of the room are GUESTS. They are the people BRAD and JANET passed on the road. They are the Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from all over the earth. It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom. They are all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear. They are a distorted version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding. A party spirit prevails, they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony.
GUESTS:「Let's do the Time Warp again.」
narrator:JANET falls into BRAD's arms.
 RIFF RAFF is ecstatic.
 BRAD revives JANET.

MAGENTA:「It's so dreamy Oh, fantasy free me So you can't see me No not at all.」

narrator:BRAD and JANET look at each other in alarm.
 In another dimension. (she forces them back towards balcony) With voyeuristic intention.
 BRAD blushes.
 Well secluded I see all With a bit of a mind flip You're into the time slip Nothing will ever seem the same.
 They are back at the balcony.
 You're spaced out on sensation.
 They are at the edge of the balcony.

JANET:「Brad, please lets get out of here.」

BRAD:「For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.」
JANET:「But it seems so unhealthy here.」
BRAD:「It's just a..a party Janet.」
JANET:「Well I want to leave.」

BRAD:「Let's wait awhile Janet. We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.」
JANET:「This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.」
BRAD:「They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own. - They may do some more folk dancing.」
JANET:「Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.」
BRAD:「I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.」

 The GUESTS scream with delight.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「I'm just a sweet Transvestite From Transexual Transylvania.」
narrator:He slowly moves back to BRAD and JANET, doing leg kicks.
 Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound You look like you're both pretty groovie.
 He circles them and forces them into the Ballroom.
 Or if you want something visual not too abysmal We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie.
 BRAD clumsily attempts to circle around FRANK. FRANK meanwhile ignores him and greets his other guests.

BRAD:「I'm glad we caught you at home Ah - could we use your phone We're both in a bit of a hurry.」
narrator:JANET joins BRAD.
JANET:「Right!」
BRAD:「We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.」

Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「I'm just a sweet transvestite From Transexual Transylvania.」

narrator:COLUMBIA escorts them to the lift.
 RIFF RAFF throws two GUESTS to the floor to make room for them. He slams the cage door.
 The two discarded GUESTS cry and claw at the cage door as the lift moves off under RIFF RAFF's control.
 BRAD and JANET are squashed, arms by their side.
 They stare straight ahead.
JANET:「to Magenta) It he - Frank - is he your husband?」
narrator:General amusement.
RIFF RAFF:「The Master is not yet married. Nor do I think he ever will be. We are simply his servants.」
JANET:「Oh.」
narrator:The lift grinds to a halt.
 They have arrived at the laboratory.
 CUT TO
 INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT
 The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating theatre and a Greek gymnasium. It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the lift entrance is a circular area containing a TANK on pedestals which though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised dias area for the GUESTS, and facing one end of the tank, the operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator. A chandelier hangs above the tank.
 On the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone.
 Near the podium are some weights. Behind the tank is a vaulting horse. These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents.
 The GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives.
 FRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room. RIFF RAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he hands to FRANK.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff.」

narrator:As he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift. They cross to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「I will entertain...ah...」
narrator:BRAD &amp; JANET step out of the lift.
BRAD:「I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.」
JANET:「Weiss.」
BRAD:「Weiss.」
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「Taking Janet's hand to kiss) Encante....How nice. (he circles them) And what charming underclothes you both have. (He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff and hands them to Brad). But here, put these on. They'll make you feel less vulnerable.」
narrator:MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA cross to the podium.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「continues) It's not often we receive visitors here. Let alone offer them hospitality.」
BRAD:「Moving towards Frank) Hospitality! All we wanted to do was use your telephone. A reasonable request which you have chosen to ignore.」
JANET:「Hurring after Brad) Don't be ungrateful Brad.」
BRAD:「Stepping closer to Frank) Ungrateful!」

narrator:The room falls silent. All eyes are on FRANK, waiting for his reaction.
 A smile breaks on his face.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「How forceful you are Brad. Such a perfect specimen of manhood. So dominant.」
narrator:MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA laugh.
 You must be awfully proud of him Janet.
JANET:「Well, yes I am.」
narrator:THE GUESTS oh and ah appreciatively, BRAD laughs, a little embarassed.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「Do you have any tattoos Brad.」
BRAD:「Certainly not!」
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「Oh well. How about you. (He laughs)」
narrator:RIFF RAFF has approached behind FRANK, looming over his shoulder.
RIFF RAFF:「Everything is in readiness, Master. We merely await your word.」
narrator:FRANK drinks his champagne then hands RIFF RAFF the empty glass. RIFF RAFF goes to the control panel and FRANK to the podium
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「Tonight...One, one, one. Can you hear me at the back? Tonight, my unconventional conventionists.」
narrator:MAGENTA, COLUMBIA and GUESTS laugh politely.

Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough in biochemical research.」
narrator:There is a gasp from COLUMBIA, MAGENTA and GUESTS.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「And paradise is to be mine.」
narrator:GUESTS and everybody applaud. JANET claps too, but BRAD indicates that she shouldn't.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「It was strange the way it happened. One of those quirks of fate really.
 One of those moments when you seem irredeemably lost: you panic; you're trapped; your back's against the wall. There's no way out, and then suddenly, you get a break. (He cracks the bones in his hand) All the pieces seem to fit into place. What a sucker you'r been. What a fool. The answer was there all the time. It took a small accident to make it happen. An accident!」
narrator:MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA step forward one each side of him.
 MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA (softly) An accident.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「That's how I discovered the secret. That elusive ingredient, that spark that is the breath of life.」
narrator:GUESTS applaud.

Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「Moving to tank) You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate. For tonight is the night that my beautiful creature is destined to be born.」
narrator:Everybody applauds. FRANK then pulls the cover from the tank. RIFF RAFF is at the control panel.
 INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT
 The tank is revealed. There is something inside it is immersed in clear fluid. The GUESTS are astonished.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「Throw open the switches on the sonic oscillator.」
narrator:RIFF RAFF flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the panel.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「And step up the reactor power input three more points.」
narrator:RIFF RAFF presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel.
 FRANK watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is lowered. It spurts different coloured liquids into the tank.
 The liquids bubble and change colour. The thing inside begins to look like a human form.
JANET:「Brad...」
BRAD:「It's alright Janet.」

narrator:The liquids drain away. The form begins to move.
 FRANK climbs the ladder at one end of the tank, RIFF RAFF the other.
 ROCKY HORROR sits up, raises his arms, finally stands upright with both arms outstretched.
 RIFF RAFF removes the bandage from ROCKY's head. ROCKY looks at RIFF RAFF then at FRANK. With a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above.
 At the same time RIFF RAFF is down the ladder making for the handle. He winds up the chandelier and ROCKY.
 INT.	THE LABORATORY	NIGHT
 SONG:
 THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES.
 ROCKY HORROR with only his head unbandaged, is hanging on to the chandelier which RIFF RAFF is winding upwards.
ROCKY:「The Sword of Damocles is Hanging over my head.」
narrator:FRANK runs down the ladder and kicks RIFF RAFF who starts to lower the chandelier. FRANK climbs up the other steps to meet his creation coming down. MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA cross to the tank.
ROCKY:「And I've got the feeling Someone's going to be Cutting the thread.」
narrator:Oh, woe is me. My life is a misery.
 Oh, can't you see That I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer....
 As ROCKY gets level with him, FRANK lunges for him but lands inside the tank....because...
 ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between MAGENTA and COLUMBIA who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip his arm and leg bandages.
ROCKY:「I woke up this morning With a start When I fell out of bed.」
GUESTS:「inc. Riff, Magenta &amp; Columbia) That ain't no crime.」
ROCKY:「And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.」
GUESTS:「That ain't no crime」
ROCKY:「My high is low. I'm dressed up With no place to go.」
narrator:And all I know Is I'm at the start Of a pretty big downer.
 FRANK, in the tank behind ROCKY, puts his arms round ROCKY's neck.
 ROCKY spins away. MAGENTA and COLUMBIA hang on to one end of his chest bandage so that it undoes as he goes.
GUESTS:「inc. RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA) Sha la la la That ain't no crime.」
ROCKY:「Oh, no no, no no.」
GUESTS:「Sha la la la That ain't no crime.」
ROCKY:「No no no, no no.」
GUESTS:「Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.」
narrator:ROCKY is now unbandaged. He strikes a pose.
 During the last sequence, FRANK climbs out of the tank onto RIFF RAFF'S shoulders and purses ROCKY, but they fall.

 INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT
 FRANK picks himself up. ROCKY is sitting at the top of the ladder above him, with his perfect limbs near Frank's face.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「Well. That's no way to behave on your first day out.」

narrator:ROCKY looks hurt.
 But as you're such an exceptional beauty I'm prepared to forgive.
 FRANK crosses behind ROCKY to stand next to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.
 I just love success.
RIFF RAFF:「edging up to Frank) He is a credit to your genius, Master.」
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「Yes.」
MAGENTA:「Moving to tank from controls) A triumph of your vill.」
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「Yes.」
COLUMBIA:「Who is on opposite side of tank) He's o.k.」
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「O.K? (Moving out behind tank towards Janet and Brad) I think we can do a little better than that.」
narrator:You. (To Janet) What do you think?
JANET:「Well. (She looks at Brad) I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.」
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「I didn't make him for you」

narrator:JANET nods hastily. FRANK moves towards microphone.
 He carries the Charles Atlas seal of approval....And he didn't even take the lessons.

 As FRANK starts to sing, MAGENTA &amp; RIFF RAFF collect one of ROCKY's presents, the vaulting horse, and place it in front of the podium. COLUMBIA leads ROCKY down from the ladder.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「A weakling weighing Ninety eight pounds Will get sand in his face When kicked to the ground. And soon in the gym (ROCKY sits on horse) With a determined chin The sweat from his pores As he works for his ca-ha-hause」

 He'll be a strong man - Oh honey -」
narrator:GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA &amp; COLUMBIA &amp; FRANK. But the wrong man.

Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「He'll eat nutritious high protein And swallow raw eggs. Try to build up his shoulders, His chest, arms and legs.」
narrator:Such an effort - If he only knew of my plan. In just seven days,

Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「He'll do press-ups and chin-ups, Do the snatch, clean and jerk.」
narrator:FRANK crosses to JANET &amp; BRAD
 He thinks dynamic tension Must be hard work. Such strenuous living I just don't understand.

 INT.	LABORATORY: REFRIGERATOR	NIGHT
 The large refrigeration unit door slowly opens, falling like a drawbridge. Inside is a wall of ice and many CocaCola bottles. Through these bursts an icy EDDIE riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, ex World War II, holding a Gibson guitar.
 Several guests are crushed to death.
COLUMBIA:「Eddie!」

 COLUMBIA leaps on to the pillion seat.
 I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go And listen to the music on the radio.
 The MOTORCYCLISTS GUESTS remember only too well.
 A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show And we climbed in the back And we really had a good time
 COLUMBIA rushes to the switchboard, flicks a lighting switch and all the lights above the stairs start changing colour.
 The GUESTS go crazy and rock and roll all over the staircase.
 COLUMBIA dances with EDDIE.
 Even RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA step it out.
ALL:「Hot patootie Bless my soul I really love that rock and roll (four times)」
narrator:EDDIE (more confident, less frozen) leaps onto the motorbike in a legs apart guitar strumming pose.
 FRANK is getting furious.
 ROCKY is perplexed.
 EDDIE My head used to swim From the perfume I smelled. My hands kind of fumbled With her white plastic belt. I'd taster her baby pink lipstick, And that's when I'd melt. And she'd whisper in my ear, Tonight she really was mine.
 Get back in front and put Some hair oil on. Buddy Holly was singing His very last song. With your arms around your girl You tried to - ah - sing along It felt pretty good, whoo. Really had a good ti-i-ime.
 EDDIE slips onto the pedal starting the bike. He takes off and roars round the laboratory, even riding up and down the walls.
ALL:「Hot patootie Bless my soul. I really love that rock and roll.」

BRAD:「You mean...」
narrator:DR. SCOTT Yes Brad. It's something we ourselves have been working on. But it seems our friend here has found a way of perfecting it. A device which is capable of breaking down solid matter and then projecting it through space, and - who knows - perhaps even time itself!

 INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

NARRATOR:And so, by some extraordinary coincidence - fate it seems had decided that Brad and Janet should keep that appointment with their friend Dr Everett Scott. But it was to be in a situation which none of them could have possibly foreseen. And just a few hours after announcing their engagement, Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden fruit. This in itself was proof that their host was a man of little morals - and some persuasion. What further indignities were they to be subjected to? And what of the sonic transducer and floor show that had been spoken of? What indeed? From what had gone before, it was clear that this was to be no picnic.

 At the top of the staircase FRANK appears bathed in light.
 He wears a dazzling version of the national costume and a chiffon cloak which billows in the breeze from a wind machine. He is reminiscent of a 30's film star.
Dr. Frank-N-Furter:「What ever happened to Fay Wray That delicate satin-draped frame As it clung to her thigh How I started to cry For I wanted to be dressed just the same.」

 The wind machine blows the blanked from his lap and we see legs, stockings and a suspender belt. As in a miracle he can walk again.
