narrator:DANNY SITS BETWEEN TWO OTHER MALE PATIENTS.
DANNY:「And it was just the way I wanted it, but he cut it back too far. He cut this side back too far trying to even it up. I didn't tell him to do that. I said, "Just cut it the way you cut it...."」

And they escape up into the mountains and they're gonna be happy, and they're gonna be drinking wine and they dance -- they both like to dance with each other, there's scenes of them dancing, which was boring, but I liked it, because they were happy. You think he ends it there? No! He writes another ending. She dies, Dad! I mean, the world's hard enough as it is, guys. It's fucking hard enough as it is. Can't somebody say, "Hey, let's be positive? Let's have a good ending to the story?"」
DOLORES:「Pat, you owe us an apology.」

narrator:DR. PATEL You can call me Cliff, please.

Pat Solitano:「pull the curtain back and there's the fucking history...」

Pat Solitano:「And you know what he says to me?」

Pat Solitano:「So yeah, I snapped. I almost beat him to death. But now I get fucking chastised for it? I'm parallel to my father? I don't think so.」
narrator:DR. PATEL All right. Can you talk about something that you did, before or after?
Pat Solitano:「Yeah, about a week before the incident, I called the cops and I told them that my wife and the history guy were plotting against me by embezzling money from the local high school, which wasn't true. It was a delusion. And we later found out from the hospital that's because I'm, uh...」
narrator:DR. PATEL ...undiagnosed bipolar.
Pat Solitano:「Yeah. With mood swings and weird thinking brought on by severe stress, which rarely happens, thank God. And then the shower incident happened and that's when everything snapped, so I then realized that, oh, wow, I've been dealing with this my whole life. And without any supervision I've been doing it all on my own with no help and basically I've been white-knuckling it this whole time.」

narrator:DR. PATEL That had to be hard.

Pat Solitano:「Congratulations on the baby, but I'm not buying the invitation.」

Pat Solitano:「I know Veronica still hates me.」

Pat Solitano:「Nikki's waiting for me to get in shape and get my life in order, and then she's gonna be with me. And that's better than any medication.」

narrator:DR. PATEL Pat, there's a possibility, and I want you to be prepared for it, that she may not return. True love is about letting her go and seeing if she returns. In the meantime, if you listen to that song, I don't want you to fall apart. So get a strategy, okay? You need one.
Pat Solitano:「Let me say something, I gotta say something.」
narrator:DR. PATEL Okay.
Pat Solitano:「This is what I believe to be true. This is what I learned in the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, if you stay positive, you have a shot at a silver lining.」

Pat Solitano:「Hey, you know my dad lost his pension.」
RONNIE:「I'm sorry, man.」
Pat Solitano:「Yeah.」
RONNIE:「A lot of people. My uncle, too.」
Pat Solitano:「Really?」

Pat Solitano:「Here's a fun fact. You know where the term "OK" comes from?」
VERONICA:「No. No, I don't.」
RONNIE:「Where?」
Pat Solitano:「Well, Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States of America, is from Kinderhook, New York...」
VERONICA:「Oh.」
Pat Solitano:「and he was part of a club, a men's club, called Old Kinderhook. And if you were cool, you were in the club, they'd say, "That guy's OK." `Cause he was in the Old Kinderhooks.」
RONNIE:「Really?」
Pat Solitano:「Yeah. Pretty cool, right?」

VERONICA:「You know, Tiffany's been doing this dance thing for years and she's real good at it. She's gonna be competing at the Ben Franklin Hotel.」

TIFFANY:「I said I'm tired. (to Pat) Are you gonna walk me home or what?」
Pat Solitano:「You mean me?」
TIFFANY:「Yeah, you. Are you gonna walk me home?」

Pat Solitano:「You have poor social skills. You have a problem.」

Pat Solitano:「Look, I had a really good time tonight and I think you're really pretty, but I'm married, okay?」
narrator:PAT HOLDS UP HIS HAND, DISPLAYING HIS WEDDING RING.
TIFFANY:「You're married? So am I.」

Pat Solitano:「I'm not the big slut!」
narrator:TIFFANY STOPS AND REACTS, BENDING OVER. PAT STOPS AND WALKS.
Pat Solitano:「」

narrator:DR. PATEL You seemed to have trouble last night.
Pat Solitano:「Let me just set the record straight about last night. Hurting my mother was a mistake and I hate myself for it, and I hate my illness and I want to control it. My father, on the other hand, had no trouble slapping the shit out of me last night, which I did not return `cause I could've killed him and I didn't. He's sixty-five years old. You don't think I could've beat the shit out of him? I mean....」
narrator:DR. PATEL He was scared for your mother and you hurt him as well.
Pat Solitano:「Yes, last night was a mess. Okay? And I think he probably just tried to do his best.」
narrator:DR. PATEL Pat, you have to have a strategy. I told you earlier. You need to recognize these feelings coming to you, otherwise you will be sent back to Baltimore. So when you get these feelings, you need to get to a quieter place, and be at peace with yourself, however you can.
Pat Solitano:「Yeah, but that's easier said than done.」
narrator:DR. PATEL You have to do it. You have no choice. Excelsior.

Pat Solitano:「Yeah, Excelsior. Listen, I have a letter I want you to give Nikki, okay?」
narrator:DR. PATEL No.
Pat Solitano:「Why?」

narrator:DR. PATEL Because you have a restraining order.
 PAT
 SIGHS) What good are you, man?
 DR. PATEL Why did you have this overwhelming urgency to see your wedding video last night?
Pat Solitano:「Oh, I don't know, because I'm married and I haven't seen my wife in eight and a half months?」
narrator:DR. PATEL Maybe you think that Nikki's not around and Tiffany's an attractive girl and if you get drawn towards Tiffany, you will spoil your chances of getting Nikki back to you?
Pat Solitano:「Not bad, Doctor Jones. But I don't think I'm gonna blow it with Nikki because Tiffany's a slut.」
narrator:DR. PATEL Why is she a slut?
Pat Solitano:「After the dinner at Ronnie's, she said, quote, "We can go to the back house and you can fuck me as long as we turn the lights out." Unquote. And she still wears her wedding ring. So she's a loyal, married-to-a-dead-guy slut.」
narrator:DR. PATEL Maybe she just needs a friend and she thought if she offers you sex, it will be easier for you to become friends with her.

Pat Solitano:「She said she's not a whore anymore, but she likes that part of herself along with all the other parts of herself and can I say the same?」

Pat Solitano:「Is that....? You're asking me, you're really asking me that question?」
narrator:DR. PATEL Yes.
Pat Solitano:「With all my crazy sad shit? What, are you fucking nuts?」
narrator:DR. PATEL Pat, the silver lining thing is yours. I'm just giving back your words to you. This "crazy sad shit," as you call it, made you a happier, calmer person with a beautiful positive philosophy of going outdoors, working out, and reading books.
Pat Solitano:「No, not the books.」

 TIFFANY
 CHEWING) Because you ordered Raisin Bran.
Pat Solitano:「I ordered Raisin Bran because I didn't want there to be any mistaking this for a date.」
narrator:TIFFANY
 CHEWING) It can still be a date if you order Raisin Bran.
Pat Solitano:「It's not a date. So how's your thing going -- your dancing thing?」
TIFFANY:「It's good. How's your restraining order?」
Pat Solitano:「I wouldn't actually call the restraining order "my thing," but getting back with Nikki is, and I've been doing pretty well. Except for a minor incident at the doctor's office.」
TIFFANY:「And the so-called incident with the weights.」
Pat Solitano:「Yeah. That was a thing with my parents. I wish I could just explain it all in a letter to Nikki because it was minor and I could just explain it and let her know that I'm actually not out of control and that I'm actually doing really well.」
narrator:TIFFANY TAKES THIS IN. BEAT.
TIFFANY:「I can get a letter to Nikki. I see her sometimes with my sister.」

narrator:PAT CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE IS HEARING.
Pat Solitano:「It would be so amazing if you could get a letter to Nikki from me.」

TIFFANY:「I'd have to hide it from Veronica. She's not into breaking the law, which this letter would definitely be doing.」
Pat Solitano:「But you would do it?」
TIFFANY:「I'd have to be careful. I'm already on thin ice with my family, you should hear how I lost my job.」
Pat Solitano:「How did you lose your job?」
TIFFANY:「By...having sex with everybody in the office.」
Pat Solitano:「Everybody?」
TIFFANY:「I was very depressed after Tommy died. It was a lot of people.」

narrator:SEDUCE YOU--
TIFFANY:「Made me sit on her lap and do things? Yeah.」
Pat Solitano:「What? You sat on her lap?」
TIFFANY:「Mm-hmm.」
Pat Solitano:「She told you what to do?」
TIFFANY:「Mm-hmm.」
Pat Solitano:「Oh...my God. Nikki hated when I talked like this. Made me feel like such a pervert. Maybe we should change the subject.」
TIFFANY:「I don't mind it.」
Pat Solitano:「You don't, do you.」

Pat Solitano:「I get it. The song that was playing when my wife...was in the shower with the history teacher...」
TIFFANY:「I heard about that.」
Pat Solitano:「it was my wedding song and when I hear it, I go kinda crazy. Sometimes I hear it when it's not even playing.」
TIFFANY:「Wow.」
Pat Solitano:「Yeah. So they put me on medication, which I feel ashamed of.」
TIFFANY:「Yeah.」
Pat Solitano:「So I know.」
TIFFANY:「You do.」
Pat Solitano:「I just gotta get a strategy, you know?」
TIFFANY:「Me too.」
Pat Solitano:「We'd better get back to the letter.」
TIFFANY:「Yeah, let's get back to the letter.」
Pat Solitano:「What if you told Nikki when Veronica was in the bathroom?」
TIFFANY:「Yes. Yes, that could work. I love that.」
Pat Solitano:「Oh, my God, I'm gonna go home and write the letter right now.」

TIFFANY:「Can I at least finish my tea?」
Pat Solitano:「Wait, what?」
TIFFANY:「My tea. Can I finish it?」
Pat Solitano:「Wait a minute. Did Veronica tell Nikki about our dinner? Why would she do that? Was it a test?」
TIFFANY:「I kinda got that feeling, yeah.」
Pat Solitano:「Goddamn it. I knew it. It was a test. How did I do? I think I did pretty well.」
TIFFANY:「Yeah, she said you were cool, basically.」
Pat Solitano:「Basically"? Was I some percentage not cool?」
TIFFANY:「No, she said you were cool, but you know.」
Pat Solitano:「No, I don't know.」
TIFFANY:「Sort of how you are. It's fine, relax.」
Pat Solitano:「What do you mean? How am I? What does that mean?」
TIFFANY:「Sort of like me.」
Pat Solitano:「Sort of like you"? I hope to God she didn't tell Nikki that.」

Pat Solitano:「Because, it's just not right, lumping you and I together, I mean, it's just wrong. And Nikki wouldn't like that. Especially after all the shit you just told me.」
TIFFANY:「You think that I'm crazier than you.」
narrator:PAT
 SCOFFS) (CHUCKLING) Because, well, we're different, I

Pat Solitano:「What? Hey, calm down! Hey--」

Pat Solitano:「Can I just explain myself, please? I didn't want Nikki to think that I was associated with that kind of sexual behavior because I've never done anything like that, okay?」
TIFFANY:「You may not have experienced the shit that I did. But you loved hearing about it, didn't you? You are afraid to be alive, you're afraid to live. You're a hypocrite. You're a conformist. You're a liar. I opened up to you and you judged me. You are an asshole. You are an asshole!」

TIFFANY:「I can't give the letter to Nikki.」
Pat Solitano:「Tiffany, what are you talking about? What do you mean you can't give the letter to Nikki?」
TIFFANY:「Because what am I getting in return? What are you doing for me?」
Pat Solitano:「You said! You said if I wrote a letter, you'd get it to Nikki.」
TIFFANY:「I know.」
Pat Solitano:「That was the set-up.」
TIFFANY:「Because I do this time after time after time, I do all this shit for other people and then I wake up and, and I'm empty, I have nothing!」
Pat Solitano:「What are you talking about? You seem like you're a tough girl to me. Why don't you just do things on your own?」
TIFFANY:「I always get myself in these fucking situations. I give everything to other people and nobody ever, I never -- I don't get what I want, okay? I'm not my sister. Pat takes this in.」
Pat Solitano:「Alright, well, ask for you. What can I do for you?」

TIFFANY:「I can't do it.」
Pat Solitano:「Tiffany, what do you want me to do?」

narrator:TIFFANY SIGHS.
Pat Solitano:「Think of something.」
TIFFANY:「There's this thing.」
Pat Solitano:「There's a thing, okay. What kind of thing?」
TIFFANY:「It's a thing, it's a thing. It's a, it's a dance thing.」
Pat Solitano:「It's a dance thing, all right.」
TIFFANY:「It's a competition thing at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Tommy would never do it with me and I missed it every single year.」
Pat Solitano:「Well, Tommy's dead, so he's not gonna fucking do it.」
TIFFANY:「Would you please!」
Pat Solitano:「I don't have a filter when I talk.」
TIFFANY:「Can we have one conversation without you reminding me that my goddamn husband is dead? My God.」
Pat Solitano:「Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm sorry.」
TIFFANY:「But I can only do it if I have a partner...and now I'm about to miss it for another year.」

TIFFANY:「How are you in love? Tell me about that. The big Nikki love. Tell me about it, I wanna understand it.」
Pat Solitano:「We have a very unconventional chemistry, it makes people feel awkward, but not me. She's the most beautiful woman I've ever been with.」
TIFFANY:「Wow.」
Pat Solitano:「It's electric between us, okay? Yeah, we wanna change each other, but that's normal, couples wanna do that, I want her to stop dressing like she dresses, I want her to stop acting so superior to me, okay? And she wanted me to lose weight and stop my mood swings, both of which I've done. I mean, people fight. Couples fight. We would fight, we wouldn't talk for a couple weeks. That's normal. She always wanted the best for me. Tiffany listens.
 She wanted me to be passionate and compassionate. And that's a good thing. You know? I just, look, I'm my best self today, and I think she's her best self today, and our love's gonna be fucking amazing.」

It's a bunch of boys on an island and they have a conch -- they have a shell -- and whoever has the conch has the power and they can talk.

 PAT SR. Patty. Where have you been? Huh?
 PAT GROANS.
 PAT SR. We got a serious situation on our hands, you know that. Pat looks concerned, he could be in trouble.
 PAT SR. We gotta beat the Giants if we wanna have a chance of getting into the division, any chance of playing in the playoffs. Do you realize that?
Pat Solitano:「I didn't realize that.」

narrator:PAT SR. Yeah, that's the bind we're in. I mean, I think it would be wise if we spent father-son time, reading about the Eagles, talking about them, just to strengthen the good luck thing that you're in.
Pat Solitano:「Okay.」
narrator:PAT SR. Yeah?
Pat Solitano:「Right.」

RANDY:「All the money that he needs for the restaurant, he's betting on the Giant game.」
narrator:PAT SR. Tell him why.
RANDY:「Because he believes in you.」
Pat Solitano:「Is that true?」
narrator:PAT SR. I believe in you, Patty. I believe in you. I want you to know that. So I'm gonna bet heavy on this game.

narrator:PAT SR. No. I'd love to go to the game, too, but as you know, I'm banned from the stadium. `Cause I'd love to see us beat the Giants and take a lot of money from this asshole.
RANDY:「Listen, personally, I think it's a stupid bet. As a matter of fact, I think it's ridiculous to bet all that dough for the restaurant on a game.」
narrator:PAT SR. Randy. (to Pat) I just hope you heard what I said. It's like a family business, it's our family endeavor. We all stick together on this. That's how it works. That's a positive, positive vibe.
Pat Solitano:「I made a commitment to Tiffany about a project, and we have a very important part of it that we have to go over on Sunday, and it's good for me, Dad. It's making me disciplined and focused, and it's, it's--, I never would've thought this, but it's a good thing.」
narrator:PAT SR. What is this thing you're doing?
DOLORES:「Yeah, what is it? What is this project, hon?」
Pat Solitano:「It's a dance thing, okay? There's nothing more to it, Dad. I swear.」

narrator:TIFFANY AND PAT.
Pat Solitano:「Listen, I need to ask you something.」

Pat Solitano:「Tomorrow can I spend half the day with you and half the day at the Eagles game?」
TIFFANY:「I'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.」
Pat Solitano:「Why?」
TIFFANY:「These are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. It's not ready yet. And we don't have a move yet.」
Pat Solitano:「I know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and I wanna be of service to him, okay? And he's worried that the juju from the Eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because I'm spending time with you.」
TIFFANY:「Oh, I messed up the Eagles' juju?」
Pat Solitano:「No, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because I'm not with him during the games.」
TIFFANY:「Guess what?」
Pat Solitano:「What?」

Pat Solitano:「Tiff, I'm sorry. I can't do anything else without reading Nikki's letter, okay? It's just--, it's in the back of my head. We don't almost have it, all right?」
TIFFANY:「I just hope you can handle it.」
Pat Solitano:「Thank you.」
narrator:TIFFANY PICKS UP THE ENVELOPE AND TURNS.
Pat Solitano:「What was her energy when she gave it to you?」

 CAMERA TILTS DOWN ONTO HIS HANDS, OPENING THE ENVELOPE.
TIFFANY:「Try to stay positive.」
narrator:PAT'S HANDS UNFOLD THE TYPED LETTER.
Pat Solitano:「I'm just gonna read it out loud, okay? Because if she says anything that's, you know, is that too much to ask?」
TIFFANY:「No.」
narrator:PAT LOOKS DOWN AT THE LETTER, READING SILENTLY.
TIFFANY:「I thought you were gonna read it out loud.」

Pat Solitano:「Okay. Sorry.」

Pat Solitano:「"Dear Pat, It was very emotional for me to get your letter, as I'm sure you can imagine, but I'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through Tiffany. This gives us a chance to communicate while I keep the restraining order until I feel safe. I must admit you sound terrific and I'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which I always knew you were. I was moved to read about `Excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. I am also moved by your act of love to read the books I have taught at the high school. I'm sorry you find them so negative, but I disagree. I think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. In spite of all these positive developments, Pat, I have to say if it's me reading the signs, I need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. Otherwise I find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. Please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. I'm glad you're doing so well. Love, Nikki." PAT FOLDS UP THE LETTER AGAIN. He is kind of crying.
 I think I'm done for today, okay?」

TIFFANY:「follows him to door) She said to show her something, Pat. This dance can be that something. You would have never done something like this in a million years. It shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline. It's romantic, like I said it would be. It's for her.」
Pat Solitano:「over his shoulder) Thanks for the letter. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?」

narrator:PAT AND PAT SR.
Pat Solitano:「Can I use your phone?」
narrator:PAT SR. Is it an emergency?
Pat Solitano:「Yeah, kind of.」
narrator:PAT SR. What kind of emergency?
Pat Solitano:「Well, I'm just doing this project with Tiffany and I wanted to tell her I'm not gonna be on time.」
narrator:PAT SR. Just don't make her an emergency, that crazy girl, you know?
Pat Solitano:「She's not crazy -- I'll just borrow Jake's phone. It's too bad you can't come in to the stadium, but I know you were kicked out, you know, for beating everybody up. Guess we're not that different, huh, Dad?」
narrator:PAT SR. That a bad thing?
Pat Solitano:「No, I think, it's a good thing.」

 RONNIE MOVES IN FRONT OF THE CROWD, SHAKING HIS FIST.
RONNIE:「Okay, you know what? I don't have her phone number. If you want, if you really want, you can call Veronica `cause she does, but I don't want to talk to Veronica.」
Pat Solitano:「Why don't you wanna talk to Veronica?」

RONNIE:「Because she brings me down, man! She just brings me down.」
Pat Solitano:「You have to change. You're not gonna throw the marriage away. There's some kind of love there. I know, I used to see it.
 You guys have a beautiful thing that got broken somewhere along the line and you gotta fix it like a chiropractor. You gotta give it a chiropractic adjustment.」

narrator:RONNIE CHUCKLES
Pat Solitano:「Enough with awkwardness! I don't wanna walk in your house and not be able to say what I wanna say.」
RONNIE:「You're right, man. You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, man.」
narrator:A MALE EAGLES FAN WALKS THROUGH THE CROWD, FOLLOWED BY
 SEVERAL MALE FRIENDS.
 FAN #1 Eagles, baby! Yeah! Let's go!

 FAN #1 What the fuck? What's that smell?
 FAN #1 AND HIS FRIENDS LOOK BG. AT SEVERAL INDIAN MEN IN

 FAN #1 Nasty Indian curry! This is America, baby! Go back to your country!
 RONNIE, PAT AND JAKE. RONNIE LOOKS AT FAN #1 AND HIS FRIENDS,

Pat Solitano:「I'm not gonna go anywhere.」
RONNIE:「Don't get in a fight!」

 FRIENDS AND INDIANS FIGHT.
Pat Solitano:「」

narrator:PAT SR. What happened?
 PAT
 DAD--
 PAT SR.
 INTERRUPTING) What the fuck happened?
Pat Solitano:「Dad.」
narrator:PAT. DR. PATEL, RONNIE AND JAKE STAND BEHIND HIM.
 PAT SR. The birds lose, I lose a fuckin' fortune, a fortune to Randy! What the fuck did you do?! You fucking lost it! I thought you said you had it together! You were solid!
Pat Solitano:「I am solid. I was solid at the game, Dad. I'm solid, I'm solid now.」
narrator:PAT SR. You fell apart! What are you fucking talking about?!
 DR. PATEL Your son was trying to--
 PAT SR. It's all fucking ruined now. It's all ruined.
Pat Solitano:「No, Dad!」
narrator:PAT SR. TURNS, REMOVING HIS JERSEY. PAT STEPS TOWARD HIM.
 PAT SR. AS HE STRUGGLES TO PULL HIS JERSEY OFF.
 PAT SR.
 YELLING) It's all fucking ruined now! It's all fucking ruined!
Pat Solitano:「No, Dad, Dad, Dad, don't!」

Pat Solitano:「No, Dad! I didn't do a fucking thing! Come on, Dad!」
narrator:PAT SR.
 YELLING) You loser! You loser!
 PAT SR. SHOVES PAT.
 PAT
 EMOTIONAL) I'm not a loser.
 PAT SR. You fucking loser! You ruined everything!
 DR. PATEL He was defending his brother!
 PAT CRIES
 PAT SR. You fucking idiot! You spike the ball on the one yard line, you fucking idiot!
 THE DOORBELL RINGS.
 DOLORES LOOKS AT THE FRONT DOOR.
 THE GROUP WATCHES AS TIFFANY WALKS INTO THE ROOM.
 PAT SR. Who is this?! Who's this?!
 TIFFANY WALKS TO PAT.
TIFFANY:「We need to talk right now! When you make a serious commitment to somebody, it is not cool to not show up!」
Pat Solitano:「Wait a second, I tried to call, my God, what's happening, I called--, but I tried to call you, Tiffany,」

Pat Solitano:「Yes.
 I told you I was gonna split my time with my dad and you, and my dad was pulling me in one direction. Doctor Patel, Ronnie--」
TIFFANY:「Well, that sounds great, Pat. That's great for all of them, but all of them didn't make a commitment to me in return for my help. I'm Tiffany, by the way.」
narrator:PAT SR. What is this craziness with Tiffany Maxwell?
Pat Solitano:「There's no craziness. I told you who she was, I was doing this thing with her. We had a conversation!」

narrator:PAT SR. Be my guest.
TIFFANY:「The first night that Pat and I met at my sister's, the Eagles beat the Forty Niners handily, forty to twenty-six. The second time we got together we went for a run and the Phillies beat the Dodgers seven to five in the NLCS.」
JAKE:「She's right, Dad.」
TIFFANY:「The next time we went for a run the Eagles beat the Falcons, twenty- seven to fourteen.」
Pat Solitano:「Wow.」
TIFFANY:「The third time we got together we had Raisin Bran in the diner and the Phillies dominated Tampa Bay in the fourth game of the World Series, ten to two.」
Pat Solitano:「Oh, wow.」

TIFFANY:「There have been no games since Pat and I have been rehearsing every day and if Pat had been with me like he was supposed to, he wouldn't have gotten in a fight, he wouldn't be in trouble, maybe the Eagles beat the New York Giants.」
JAKE:「She's making a lot of sense, Pop. That's all right on all counts.」
TIFFANY:「Does anybody here happen to know what the official motto of the state of New York is on the official seal of the State of New York? Huh? Anybody? (to Pat Sr.) Do you? Do you know? "Excelsior." Look it up. Yeah, "Excelsior."」
DOLORES:「Oh Pat.」
TIFFANY:「Not that I give a fuck about football or about your superstitions, but if it's me reading the signs, I don't send the Eagles guy whose personal motto is "Excelsior," to a fucking Giants game, especially when he's already in a legal situation.」
RONNIE:「Unbelievable.」
Pat Solitano:「Wow. How did you know all that stuff?」

Pat Solitano:「Oh, now you like her, Dad?」
narrator:PAT SR. I have to say I do. Yup.
RANDY:「Patrizio, I feel terrible, you know? You made the bet, I won a lot of money, and now look, your whole family is in turmoil.」
TIFFANY:「Oh, fuck off, Randy. You love it. You live for this shit. You've been betting against my father for years.」
Pat Solitano:「Is that right?」
TIFFANY:「You're twisting the knife right now. You get off on it!」
RANDY:「That's bullshit! That's not true! Don't say that!」
TIFFANY:「You get off on it! If not, then prove it. Prove it.」
narrator:PAT SR. Yeah, prove it, prove it!
RANDY:「How do you want me to prove it?」
narrator:PAT SR. How's he gonna prove it?
TIFFANY:「By giving them the chance to win back everything, double or nothing.」
Pat Solitano:「No, no, no, no, no, no, no.」

narrator:She pauses, turns dramatically to Randy.
TIFFANY:「Against the Cowboys.」
narrator:EVERYONE GASPS.
TIFFANY:「That's your team isn't it, Randy?」
Pat Solitano:「That's his team!」
TIFFANY:「I know who his team is.」
RANDY:「When is the game?」
TIFFANY:「December twenty-eight, last game of the season.」
Pat Solitano:「Oh, my God.」

narrator:PAT SR. I believe in the Eagles, I believe in my son, I'll take the action. I'll take it.
Pat Solitano:「Dad!」
DOLORES:「Patrizio, don't! It's toxic!」
narrator:PAT SR. I have faith, I have faith. Excelsior belongs in this house--
 PAT
 DAD--
 PAT SR. --not in the State of New York. In this house.
Pat Solitano:「Dad, listen to me. I didn't know that "Excelsior" was the state motto of New York, okay?」
narrator:PAT SR. I didn't know, either, but now I know.
Pat Solitano:「I know, but listen to me, this is toxic. Dad, Dad, Dad, this is toxic, you shouldn't be doing this, you shouldn't be doing--」
narrator:PAT SR. Randy, what do you say-- (to Pat) Be quiet, shut up. You already did enough. (to Randy) Randy, what do you say? My birds, Benjamin Franklin's team favored by one and a half points. I'll give you three more.
DOLORES:「Patrizio, stop it! And Randy, don't you take the bet!」

narrator:PAT SR. In fact, I'll give you ten points.
Pat Solitano:「No, Dad! Dad!」

JAKE:「Dad!」
narrator:PAT SR. You have to take that bet on the Cowboys.
RANDY:「Dolores, would you stop him?」
JAKE:「Jesus!」
narrator:PAT SR. How could you not take that bet? Even with the ten points I give you, that's an insane spread to your advantage. Cowboys are cowards. And I'll bet you're such a coward, you won't take the ten. Plus, are you listening, plus whatever their score is at the dance thing. (to Tiffany) What's that? Tiffany, what's that?
Pat Solitano:「What? No, no, no, no.」
RANDY:「You're crazy to give away that many points. That's ridiculous! I won't take that! However, wait a second. I do like the idea of a parlay.」
DOLORES:「What? No parlay! No!」
Pat Solitano:「No, don't do it. Don't do it.」
RANDY:「Pat, how do they run this dance competition? I mean, how do they score it and everything?」

Pat Solitano:「I don't know, I don't know how they fucking score! We're participating. We're not, we're not a part of it. There are people, this is a high- end dance contest. I don't know. Do not put it as part of the parlay, Randy. Don't--」

TIFFANY:「They go by the Philadelphia rules. Each dancer is scored on a scale of one to ten, ten being the highest. You have to average the four judges' scores.」
RANDY:「Okay, score is from one to ten, right? And you guys are how good?」
Pat Solitano:「We suck.」
TIFFANY:「We don't suck. Pat's a beginner, I'm okay, we're happy just to be going there.」
RANDY:「And how are the people you're competing against?」
TIFFANY:「They're good. Some of them are professionals.」
RANDY:「They're good? Better than you? Pause. Tiffany says nothing.」
Pat Solitano:「A lot better.」
RANDY:「A lot better. So if I was to say you only have to score five, I would be really very generous, right?」
Pat Solitano:「No, no, that would be amazing if we got five. Let's not get away--」
TIFFANY:「Oh, come on, we can get a five out of ten! Gimme a break! Gimme me a break!」
Pat Solitano:「We can't get five!」

TIFFANY:「We can do a five.」
Pat Solitano:「What are you talking about, Dad? You haven't even seen us dance!」
RANDY:「That's the parlay.」
narrator:DR. PATEL Will somebody please explain to me the parlay? Please?
RONNIE:「You gotta win two bets or you lose the whole thing. For Pat Sr. to win, the birds gotta beat the Cowboys plus Pat and Tiffany gotta get at least a five at the dance.」
narrator:DR. PATEL That's very, very manic indeed.
RONNIE:「That's the parlay.」
RANDY:「Shake on it.」
Pat Solitano:「You know what? I'm not gonna be a part of this. (to Randy) Randy, Randy, you're a sickness. You're a fucking sickness, Randy. I'm out.」
TIFFANY:「Pat, you can't quit.」
Pat Solitano:「I'm not doing the dance. I'm out.」
TIFFANY:「Pat, calm down. Thank about it.」
Pat Solitano:「See you later.」

narrator:PAT
 WALKING OUT) I'm out.
 PAT SR.
 FOLLOWS HIM) Here we are again at the one yard line. DeSean, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. There you go.
Pat Solitano:「What does that even mean, Dad? I'm not gonna make that, that, that connection that you're making with DeSean Jackson. It doesn't matter anymore okay? Just because I have the fucking jersey on...I'm not gonna do it. I'm sorry.」
TIFFANY:「You are not a stand up guy right now. If it's me reading the signs...if it's me reading the」
narrator:SIGNS--
Pat Solitano:「If it's you reading the signs? You're reading the signs? Oh, okay.」

narrator:TIFFANY, SITTING ON THE FLOOR AND STRETCHING.
TIFFANY:「Hey.」
narrator:PAT ENTERS, SITS DOWN NEXT TO HER.
Pat Solitano:「Hey, what's up? Sorry I'm late.」

narrator:PAT STARES AT TIFFANY AS SHE STRUGGLES TO TIE HIS NECKTIE. SHE FUMBLES. She is agitated as he studies her.
TIFFANY:「This isn't working!」
narrator:TIFFANY YANKS OFF THE NECKTIE AND STEPS. PAT WATCHES.
TIFFANY:「Stupid!」
narrator:TIFFANY'S HANDS SORTS THROUGH A BOX OF TIES ON THE BED.
 TIFFANY HOLDS ANOTHER TIE. SHE PLACES IT AROUND HIS NECK.
 PAT WATCHES HER.

Pat Solitano:「Come on, it's gonna be great. Nikki's gonna be there. You know? Everything's gonna come together. It's what's meant to be. You okay?」
narrator:SHE NODS.
Pat Solitano:「Don't get wobbly on me.」

TIFFANY:「I'm not.」
Pat Solitano:「We have a dance to do. We have a parlay. You gotta stay focused.」
TIFFANY:「I'm focused.」
Pat Solitano:「Okay, let's go.」

narrator:PAT AND TIFFANY WALK, LOOKING AROUND. PAT SR. AND DOLORES
 FOLLOW.
Pat Solitano:「Look at the dancers. You see them?」

DOLORES:「Well, you knew that. Maybe you should've scouted `em.」
narrator:RANDY
 LAUGHING) Look at those fucking dancers! You can give me the money now, you know?
 PAT SR.
 TO PAT) Patty, Patty, all we have to do is we have to make a five. That's all. You stay here and watch the game with me.
TIFFANY:「The birds are better when Pat is with me. We settled that.」
narrator:PAT SR. Stay for the next quarter.
Pat Solitano:「Relax, we're gonna do fine, okay? I'll see you in a little bit. I'll see you up there, okay?」
narrator:PAT SR. Okay.

narrator:DR. PATEL Excelsior! Pat and Tiffany walk to sign in.
Pat Solitano:「Notices he and Tiffany are holding hands) Wait, what's this?」

narrator:THEY ARE HOLDING HANDS.
TIFFANY:「What? I thought you were doing it.」
Pat Solitano:「Oh, I thought you were doing it. We're doing a dance thing anyway, for God's sake.」
