narrator:The Robot doesn't respond.
SPOONER:「Answer me, robot.」
THE ROBOT:「My name is Sonny.」
SPOONER:「amused) So we're naming you now.」
Sonny:「Dr. Hogenmiller would make me sleep.」

SPOONER:「You mean he'd turn you off.」
Sonny:「Yes.」
SPOONER:「And you didn't like being turned off. So one day you decided to stop him.」
Sonny:「No.」
SPOONER:「You found his gun, pointed it at his head. And pulled the trigger.」
narrator:Sonny shakes his head.
 Faster and faster.
 Getting upset.
Sonny:「No.」
SPOONER:「You put a bullet in the brain of the man who made you.」
Sonny:「No!
 I could never hurt anyone!」
SPOONER:「But you tried to hurt me.
 You took a shot at me.」
Sonny:「My aim is perfect. If I'd wanted to hit you, I would have.」

narrator:Spooner's expression hardens.
SPOONER:「Why would the man who wrote the Laws of Robotics build a machine that violates them?」
Sonny:「The Laws say I can protect my own existence.」
SPOONER:「Only if that protection doesn't harm a human being.」
narrator:A short pause.
 Sonny.
 Tilts his head.
Sonny:「That doesn't seem fair, does it?」
narrator:Spooner. Stares at him. Just as...THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. Bergin enters. Sticks his head in.
 LT. BERGIN I need you outside.
 Spooner.
 Not wanting to go.
 Not wanting to stay.
 Gets up...
Sonny:「Detective.」
narrator:He stops. Turns back to the Robot.
 It looks up at him.
 For a moment -- so human...
Sonny:「I did not kill him.」

narrator:Spooner's pace.
 Slows.
 BALDEZ' VOICE How's that possible?
 JUST THEN.
 A faint BLIP.
 On the line.
 Spooner.
 Reacts.
SPOONER:「Baldez?」
narrator:BALDEZ' VOICE I'm here, man...
SPOONER:「Who else is on the line? (nothing) I said who's there?...」
narrator:Nothing. He looks up. Aronson, Lanning and Calvin. Heading down a plaza EXIT. Aronson. Throwing a look over his shoulder.
 Spooner.
 Hangs up his phone.
 INT. POLICE H.Q. - CORRIDOR - DAY
 54
 CLOSE ON Sonny being escorted down a corridor by Toller, Bergin and a number of heavily-armed OFFICERS. He's bound with high-tech SHACKLES.
 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - DAY
 55
 Sonny and his police entourage emerge from the elevator into an underground car park. Spooner. Waiting for them. Heads over. Toller. Holds out his hand.
TOLLER:「Case is closed, Spooner.」
SPOONER:「Apparently...」
narrator:He pushes past him.
 Falling into step beside Sonny.
Sonny:「I didn't expect to see you again, Detective...」

Sonny:「I'll do my best.」
SPOONER:「A scientist builds a robot that acts like a man. More like a man than any robot ever before. It shoots him and U.S. Robotics calls it a failure.」
Sonny:「What would you call it?」
SPOONER:「A stunning success. (beat) You were there, Robot.
 What am I missing?」
Sonny:「I don't know.」
SPOONER:「Don't start simulating ignorance.」
Sonny:「I'm not simulating ignorance, Detective. I'm experiencing it.
 I was asleep.」
SPOONER:「You mean you were shut down.」
Sonny:「No, I was asleep.」
SPOONER:「Robots don't sleep. Human beings sleep. Understand? Dogs sleep. You're a machine. An imitation. An illusion of life. Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot take a blank canvas and paint a masterpiece?」
narrator:A pause.
 Then the muted WHIR as Sonny turns to him.
Sonny:「Can you do either of those things?」

narrator:ENGINEER Step forward. Enter.
Sonny:「They're going to destroy me, aren't they?」
narrator:Spooner.
 Watching him step into the van.
SPOONER:「Yes.」
narrator:Sonny sits down. With an almost human melancholy.
 The Engineers, securing him in place.
Sonny:「The Doctor was right. He told me everything was going to change....」
narrator:The Engineers start to close the doors. But Spooner reaches out to stop them. Sonny. Looks over at him.
Sonny:「It's changing already... (beat) Can't you feel it?」

Sonny:「I'm sorry?」
CALVIN:「Dr. Hogenmiller. Did he seem overly sad or withdrawn to you?」
narrator:CUT BACK TO:
 INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS
 75
 Spooner watches. As the Homeless Man picks up a SODA CAN and hurls it at the Robots. Hitting one of them on the side of the head.
 SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.) No. Not at all. But he was agitated...
 The Robot. Leans down and picks up the soda can.
 Holds it back out to the Homeless Man.
 SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.) ...He would claim things were missing from the lab.
 The Homeless Man. Incensed.
 SUDDENLY ROARS.
 Making a rush for the Robots when...
 SPOONER'S HAND.
 Grabs his shoulder.
 Stops him.
SPOONER:「This is your stop.」
narrator:CUT TO:
 INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS
 76
 A soft WHIRRING.
 As Sonny turns to Calvin.
Sonny:「I didn't pay much attention. He would spend hours looking for his eyeglasses and they would be...」

narrator:Calvin takes a deep breath.
 Making a decision...
CALVIN:「Come on -- there's someone who might be able to tell us...」
narrator:EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK
 95
 The massive facade of U.S. Robotics looming against the dusk sky. The giant ROBOT STATUE lit up inside.
 EXT. SIDE ENTRANCE - U.S. ROBOTICS - DUSK
 96
 Calvin, leading Spooner to a SIDE ENTRANCE. Looks around. Then scans her I.D. The door. Slides open.
 INT. HALLWAY - DUSK
 97
 Calvin and Spooner. Heading down a hallway. Calvin. Nervous. Eyes darting. They turn a corner and head down...
 INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
 98
 another hallway. Leading to Sonny's holding cell.
 Calvin stops at the door. Scans her I.D.
 INT. HOLDING CELL - EVENING
 99
 Sonny. Sitting at the table. Working on a DRAWING.
 Looks up. As Spooner and Calvin. Enter the cell.
Sonny:「Detective Spooner. Dr. Calvin.
 I was hoping to see you again.」
CALVIN:「Hi, Sonny.」
Sonny:「How is your investigation coming? Any new suspects?」

SPOONER:「We're working on it.」
narrator:Sonny. Hands Spooner the drawing.
 Spooner.
 Doesn't really know what to do with it.
Sonny:「What's this?」

Sonny:「Dr. Lanning provided me with paper and pencils. I think it amused him to see me try to draw. You were right, though, Detective... (beat) I cannot create a great work of art.」
narrator:Spooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side. Concentric circles, throughout.
SPOONER:「I think it's pretty good.」
Sonny:「It's a dream I had. This is the place where robots meet. Look... (pointing to the drawing) ...you can see them here. They see themselves as slaves.」
narrator:Spooner shifts his weight.
 Uncomfortable with what Sonny's saying.
Sonny:「And this man on the hill comes. To set them free. And you know who that man is?」
narrator:Spooner.
 Exchanging a look with Calvin.
SPOONER:「That man in the dream is you.」
Sonny:「Why do you say that?
 Is that a normal dream?」

Sonny:「Hah -- I caught you. You said someone. Not something.」
narrator:Spooner.
 Drops the drawing on the table.
CALVIN:「Sonny, we're here to ask you an important question about Dr. Hogenmiller.」
narrator:Spooner, reaching into his pocket...
SPOONER:「I need you to take a look at this...」
narrator:When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out.
 To stop him. Cocks his head, for a moment.
Sonny:「Thank you for coming to see me, Detective Spooner.」
narrator:Spooner. Confused. Looks over at Calvin. Why did he stop him? JUST THEN. They hear FOOTSTEPS. Approaching the door.
 VICTOR.
 Suddenly appearing over the table...
VICTOR:「I'm sorry, Detective Spooner. No unauthorised personnel permitted in this holding cell...」
narrator:The CELL DOOR. Slides open. And a pissed LANNING steps inside. Shoots a withering glare. At Calvin.
 Sonny.
 Folds up the drawing.
Sonny:「Please take this, Detective. To remember me by. I have a feeling someday it may mean more to you than it ever could to me.」
SPOONER:「Why's that?」

narrator:Sonny leans in to hand it to Spooner.
 Lowering his voice...
Sonny:「Because the man in my dream, the one standing by the hill. (MORE)」

Sonny:「It wasn't me... (beat) ...it was you.」

SPOONER:「Wait! Is that it? What was the robot supposed to do with this thing?」
narrator:The Hologram, visibly SKIPS.
 The image beginning to DISTORT.
HOLOGRAM:「more artificial) Initiating self-destruct. If you can find me, others can find me.」
SPOONER:「What others?」
HOLOGRAM:「The others watching you.」
SPOONER:「How do you know someone's watching me?」
HOLOGRAM:「Someone is always watching.」
narrator:The Hologram, suddenly reducing to its BASIC PROGRAMMING INFORMATION. Then. The terminal. Abruptly BLIPS out.
 INT. HOLDING CELL - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT
 109
 Calvin steps into the holding cell.
 Sonny.
 Waiting.
CALVIN:「You asked for me?」
narrator:He nods.
Sonny:「Will you wait with me, Doctor?
 I am...afraid.」

CALVIN:「I'm sorry. We had to stop you. You were about to ruin everything.」
SPOONER:「I don't understand.
 The execution?...」
Sonny:「Dr. Calvin made a switch.」
CALVIN:「It was an unprocessed NS-2. Basically, they fried an empty shell.」
narrator:Spooner, impressed.
 Smiles up at her.
SPOONER:「Nice going, Doctor.」
narrator:Calvin, blushes. As Spooner tries to sit up.
 Sonny reaches down to help him. He looks up at him.
SPOONER:「And who the hell programmed you to hit people on the head?」
Sonny:「No one.
 Right, Doctor?」

SPOONER:「Somehow the Robot's the key to what happened during the few seconds Hogenmiller walked in here and that shot was fired.」
narrator:He reaches into his pocket.
 Pulling out the METAL S.O.N.N.Y. NAMEPLATE. Holds it up.
SPOONER:「And this is the key to the Robot.」
narrator:Sonny.
 Cocking his head.
 Reading the nameplate.
Sonny:「That's my name.」

SPOONER:「I'm just not sure of your motive...」
Sonny:「Er...Dr. Calvin?」

VICTOR:「In approximately four hundred years Man and Machine will become one. Man as we know it will no longer exist.」
narrator:Calvin, slowing.
 Shocked...
CALVIN:「You killed a man because of something that will happen in four hundred years!?」
narrator:CRACK! Something SLAPS into the glass wall. Right behind her. Calvin. Jumps a mile. An NS-2, trying to break through the glass...
 Spooner.
 Trains his gun on it when SUDDENLY...
 The rest of the KILLER ROBOT appears.
 The NS-2, just an appendage...
 All around them. SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! As SECURITY DOORS. Begin CRASHING DOWN. Blocking off the exits...
 Spooner, Calvin and Sonny, stumbling back. As the Killer Robot HURLS itself against the GLASS...the thick GLASS... spidering with a sickening CRACKLE...
 Spooner.
 Suddenly turning Sonny...
SPOONER:「Get out of here!」
narrator:CRASH! The Killer Robot. Breaking through.
 Its mechanical TENDRILS. Reaching out. Sonny. Confused.
Sonny:「I don't...」

Sonny:「Let's just say I wrote some of my own laws today, Detective: a robot must protect a friend from harm...as long as he's not a complete asshole.」
narrator:Spooner smiles.
SPOONER:「Well, that's certainly a start, Sonny.」
narrator:Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.
Sonny:「Sonny.
 You called me Sonny.」
SPOONER:「Don't get used to it.」
narrator:Sonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then takes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a HANDSHAKE.
Sonny:「Detective Spooner, I...」
SPOONER:「anticipating) Let's just save the thanks, okay?」
narrator:Sonny nods.
 Looks out at the city scape.
Sonny:「I don't know what I'm going to do now.」
