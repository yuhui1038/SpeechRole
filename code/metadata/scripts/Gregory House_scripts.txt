narration:[ Rebecca riding bus and then running into a school . Meets up with Melanie ]
Gregory House:「Why are you late ?
 You 're not going to like the answer .
 I already know the answer .
 I missed the bus .
 I do n't doubt it , no bus stops near Brad 's . You spent the night , the alarm did n't work . Or maybe it did .
 I did n't sleep with him .
 Girl , there 's ... [Interrupted ]
 I missed the bus !
 There 's something either very wrong with you , or there 's something very wrong with him .
 There 's nothing wrong with him .
 Please tell me you know that for a fact .
 Melanie , I got ta go .
 You 're lying are n't you ?
 I would n't lie to you . [ Turns to class of 5 year olds ] Good morning guys !
 Good morning Miss Rebecca !
 Everybody 's in their seats ?
 Yes !
 Ok , Sidney , why do n't you tell us what you did this weekend . Come on , Sidney , we know you 're not shy .
 How come we always have to tell you what we did , and you never tell us what you did ?
 [ giggles ]
 Ok , I had a really great weekend , but you ca n't tell Miss Melanie , ok ?
 What did you do ?
 I made a new friend . It 's so much fun to make new friends , is n't it ?
 Yeah , Yes , etc .
 Did you tell you mom and dad about your new friend ?
 Absolutely ! You should never keep anything from your parents . And I told them [ gibberish ]
 [ giggles ]
 Wh ..」

narration:Class [ more giggles ]
Gregory House:「[ gibberish ]
 [ Laughs and giggles ]」
narration:[ Rebecca goes to the board and starts writing ]
Gregory House:「C , A , T , H
 " The . "
 We know that word , " the . "」
narration:[ Rebecca collapses , on the board the words " call the nurse " are written ]
 Evil commercials ... bane of my existence !
 [ House and Wilson are walking through the hallway . All you can see is their hands and legs , showing that House is using a cane and limping . Wilson is the only one of the two wearing a lab coat . ]

Gregory House:「29 year old female , first seizure one month ago , lost the ability to speak . Babbled like a baby . Present deterioration of mental status .
 See that ? They all assume I 'm a patient because of this cane .So put on a white coat like the rest of us .
 I do n't want them to think I 'm a doctor .You see where the administration might have a problem with that attitude .
 People do n't want a sick doctor .Fair enough . I do n't like healthy patients . The 29 year old female ...
 The one who ca n't talk , I liked that part .She 's my cousin .
 And your cousin does n't like the diagnosis . I would n't either . Brain tumor , she 's gon na die , boring .No wonder you 're such a renowned diagnostician . You do n't need to actually know anything to figure out what 's wrong .
 You 're the oncologist ; I 'm just a lowly infectious disease guy .Hah , yes , just a simple country doctor . Brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely .
 She 's 29 . Whatever she 's got is highly unlikely .Protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative .
 That 's an HMO lab ; you might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set .No family history .
 I thought your uncle died of cancer .Other side . No environmental factors .
 That you know of .And she 's not responding to radiation treatment .
 None of which is even close to dispositive . All it does is raise one question . Your cousin goes to an HMO ?Come on ! Why leave all the fun for the coroner ? What 's the point of putting together a team if you 're not going to use them ? You 've got three overqualified doctors working for you . Getting bored .」

narration:[ Cut to Rebecca , into the nose , and up the blood stream . Cut to House looking through an MRI of Rebecca 's head . ]
Gregory House:「It 's a lesion .
 And the big green thing in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map is an island . I was hoping for something a bit more creative .Should n't we be speaking to the patient before we start diagnosing ?
 Is she a doctor ?No , but ...
 Everybody lies .Dr. House does n't like dealing with patients .
 Is n't treating patients why we became doctors ?
 No , treating illnesses is why we became doctors , treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable .So you 're trying to eliminate the humanity from the practice of medicine .
 If we do n't talk to them they ca n't lie to us , and we ca n't lie to them . Humanity is overrated . I do n't think it 's a tumor .First year of medical school if you hear hoof beats you think " horses " not " zebras " .
 Are you in first year of medical school ? No . First of all , there 's nothing on the CAT scan . Second of all , if this is a horse then the kindly family doctor in Trenton makes the obvious diagnosis and it never gets near this office . Differential diagnosis , peopleAneurysm , stroke , or some other ischemic syndrome .
 Get her a contrast MRI .Creutzfeld - Jakob disease .
 Mad cow ?
 Mad zebra .Wernickie 's encephalopathy ?
 No , blood thiamine level was normal .Lab in Trenton could have screwed up the blood test . I assume it 's a corollary if people lie , that people screw up .
 Re - draw the blood tests . And get her scheduled for that contrast MRI ASAP . Let 's find out what kind of zebra we 're dealing with here .」

narration:[ Cut to House standing at the elevator , he sees Cuddy and presses the down button twice ]
Gregory House:「I was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago .
 Really ? Well , that 's odd , because I had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago .You think we have nothing to talk about ?
 No , just that I ca n't think of anything that I 'd be interested in .I sign your paychecks .
 I have tenure . Are you going to grab my cane now , stop me from leaving ?That would be juvenile .」
narration:[ Both enter the elevator ]

Gregory House:「I can still fire you if you 're not doing your job .
 I 'm here from 9 to 5 .Your billings are practically nonexistent .
 Rough year .You ignore requests for consults .
 I call back . Sometimes I misdial .You 're 6 years behind on your obligation to this clinic .
 See , I was right , this does n't interest me .6 years , times 3 weeks ; you owe me better than 4 months .
 It 's 5To what ?
 Nice .Look , Dr. House , the only reason that I do n't fire you is because your reputation still worth something to this hospital .
 Excellent , we have a point of agreement . You are n't going to fire me .Your reputation wo n't last up if you do n't do your job . The clinic is part of your job . I want you to do your job .
 Well , like the philosopher Jagger once said , " You ca n't always get what you want . "」
narration:[ Scene of hospital from above , cut to hallway , Rebecca in wheelchair with Cameron , Chase , and Foreman around . ]
Gregory House:「You 're not my doctor . Are you Dr. House ?
 Thankfully no . I 'm Dr. Chase .
 Dr. House is the head of diagnostic medicine . He 's very busy , but he has taken a keen interest in your case .」

narration:[ Cut to MRI room , Rebecca is on the table ]
Gregory House:「We inject gadolinium into a vein . It distributes itself throughout your brain and acts as a contrast material for the magnetic resonance imagery .
 Basically , whatever 's in your head , lights up like a Christmas tree .
 It might make you feel a little light - headed .
 Dr. Cameron . I 'm sorry I have to stop you , there 's a problem .」
narration:[ Cut to House , busting into Cuddy 's office ]

Gregory House:「You pulled my authorization .Yes , why are you yelling ?
 No MRIs , no imaging studies , no labs .You also ca n't make long distance phone calls .
 If you 're gon na fire me at least have the guts to face me .Or photocopies ; you 're still yelling .
 I 'm ANGRY ! You 're risking a patient 's life .I assume those are two separate points .
 You showed me disrespect , you embarrassed me and as long as I 'm still work here you have ... [interrupted ]Is your yelling designed to scare me because I 'm not sure what I 'm supposed to be scared of . More yelling ? That 's not scary . That you 're gon na hurt me ? That 's scary , but I 'm pretty sure I can outrun ya .
 Oh , I looked into that philosopher you quoted , Jagger , and you 're right , " You ca n't always get what you want , " but as it turns out " if you try sometimes you get what you need . "
 So , because you want me to treat patients , you are n't letting me treat patients .I need you to do your job .」
narration:[ House comes out of Cuddy 's office ; Wilson and the ducklings are there ]

Gregory House:「Do the MRI , she folded . [ Ducklings leave , House turns to Wilson ] I 've got ta do four hours a week in this clinic until I make up the time I 've missed . 2054 . I 'll be caught up in 2054 . [ He walks into the clinic ] You better love this cousin a whole lot .」
narration:[ Cut back to MRI room Rebecca is back on the table . She is pushed into the machine . ]
Gregory House:「All right Rebecca , [ over intercom ] we know you may feel a little claustrophobic in there , but we need you to remain still .
 [ over intercom ] Ok , we 're gon na begin .」
narration:[ Machine starts up and makes weird sounds ]
Gregory House:「I do n't feel so good .
 It 's all right . Just try to relax .」
narration:[ Rebecca starts choking . Cool shot of inside her throat . You can see that it closes up ]

Gregory House:「Rebecca ? [ over intercom ] Rebecca ? [ back in booth ] Rebecca ! Get her out of there .
 Ah she probably fell asleep ; she 's exhausted .
 She was claustrophobic 30 seconds ago , she 's not sleeping . We got ta get her out of there !
 It 'll just be another minute .
 She 's having an allergic reaction to gadolinium . She 'll be dead in two minutes .
 Hold her neck .
 Oh , she 's ashen .
 She 's not breathing . Epi point five .
 Come on , I ca n't ventilate .
 Too much edema , where 's the surgical airway kit ?
 Yep , coming .」
narration:[ Cool cutting into Rebecca 's neck sounds , and real colored blood for a change . They get her bagged . ]
Gregory House:「Good call .」
narration:And we 're back to commercials ... blah ...
 [ Cut into hospital room , next day . Rebecca has a ventilator hooked up to her , and the ducklings are present ]
Gregory House:「We 'll get that tube out of your throat later today .
 Just get some rest for now .」
narration:[ They leave to hallway , House is there . ]

Gregory House:「Told you , ca n't trust people .She probably knew she was allergic to gadolinium , figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat .
 Ca n't get a picture , gon na have to get a thousand words .You actually want me to talk to the patient ? Get a history ?
 We need to know if there 's some genetic or environmental causes triggering an inflammatory response .I thought everybody lied ?
 Truth begins in lies . Think about it .That does n't mean anything , does it ?」
narration:[ House walks away ]
 [ House enters the clinic ... dun dun dun ! ]
Gregory House:「12No TV , but we 've got patients .
 Ca n't you give out the aspirin yourself ? I 'll do paperwork .I made sure your first case was an interesting one .
 Cough just wo n't go away , runny nose looks a funny color .Patient admitted complaining of back spasms .
 I think I read about something like that in the New England Journal of Medicine .Patient is orange .
 The color ?No , the fruit .
 You mean yellow ; it 's jaundice .I mean orange .
 Well , how orange ?Exam room 1 .」
narration:[ Cut to House in exam room 1 with Orange Guy ]

Gregory House:「I was playing golf and my cleat got stuck . I mean , it hurt a little but I kept playing . The next morning I could barely stand up . Well , you 're smiling so I take it that means this is n't serious .」
narration:[ House takes out his pills ]
Gregory House:「What 's that ? What are you doing ?
 Painkillers .Oh , for you , for your leg .
 No , 'cause they 're yummy . You want one ? It 'll make your back feel better .」
narration:[ Guy nods and House gives him a painkiller ]
Gregory House:「Unfortunately , you have a deeper problem . Your wife is having an affair .What ? !
 You 're orange , you moron ! It 's one thing for you not to notice , but if your wife has n't picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color , she 's just not paying attention . By the way , do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega - dose vitamins ?」
narration:[ Guy nods ]
Gregory House:「The carrots turn you yellow , the niacin turns you red . Get some finger - paints and do the math . And get a good lawyer .」
narration:[ House leaves the room ]
 [ Cut to House in another exam room , this time with a little boy ]

Gregory House:「Deep breath .It 's cold .
 Has he been using his inhaler ?Not in the past few days . He 's , um , only ten . I worry about children taking such strong medicine so frequently .
 What happened to your leg ?」
narration:[ After saying this the little boy starts to wheeze a little , and continues throughout the entire time that House is talking . ]
Gregory House:「Your doctor probably was concerned about the strength of the medicine , too . She probably weighed that danger against the danger of not breathing . Oxygen is so important during those prepubescent years , do n't you think ? Ok , I 'm gon na assume that no body 's ever told you what asthma is , or if they have , you had other things on your mind . A stimulant triggers cells in your child 's airways to release substances that inflame the air passages and cause them to contract . Mucus production increases , cell - lining starts to shed . But the steroids , the steroids ... stop the inflammation . The more often this happens ... [trails off and starts to leave the room ]What ? " The more often this happens ... "what ? "
 Forget it . If you do n't trust steroids , you should n't trust doctors .」
narration:[ House leaves ]
 [ Cut to Rebecca 's room ]

Gregory House:「My mother passed away three years ago . She had a heart attack , and my father broke his back doing construction .」
narration:[ Cameron 's pager goes off ]
Gregory House:「It 's House , it 's urgent . I 'm sorry .」
narration:[ They go outside the room and see House waiting for them there ]
Gregory House:「You could n't have knocked ?
 Steroids . Give her steroids , high doses of prednisone .You 're looking for support for a diagnosis of cerebral vasculitus .
 Inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare . Especially for someone her age .
 So is a tumor . Her SED rate was elevated .Mildly .
 That could mean anything , or nothing .
 Yeah , I know . I have no reason to think that it 's vasculitus except that it could be .」
narration:If the blood vessels were inflamed that 's gon na look exactly like what we saw on the MRI from Trenton County , and the pressure 's gon na cause neurological symptoms .
Gregory House:「You ca n't diagnose that without a biopsy .
 Yes , we can , we treat it . If she gets better we know that we 're right .And if we 're wrong ?
 We learn something else .」

narration:[ Cut to overview of hospital , and then back into Rebecca 's room ]
Gregory House:「Why steroids ?
 Just part of your treatment . You have n't had many visitors . No boyfriend ?
 Three dates . I would n't have stood by him if her were vomiting all day .
 Well , what abut work ? You must have friends from work .
 Pretty much everybody I like is 5 years old . A nurse said you 're stopping my radiation .
 We 're just trying some alternative medications . So , where 's your family from then ?
 Steroids are n't an alternative to radiation .
 The tests were n't really conclusive .
 We 're treating you for vasculitus , it 's the inflammation of blood vessels in the brain .
 It 's not a tumor ? I do n't have a tumor ?」
narration:[ Cut to hallway with Cameron and Chase ]
Gregory House:「You should have told her the truth . It 's a long shot guess .
 [ to nurse ] Thank you . [ To Chase ] If House is right , no harm , if he 's wrong we 've given a dying woman a couple days hope .
 False hope .
 If there was any other type available I would have given her that .」
narration:[ Cut to classroom where Foreman is smelling the floor ]

Gregory House:「Why are you smelling Billy 's pants ?
 I 'm not .
 Looked like you were .
 I was smelling the floor .
 Oh .
 Do you have any pets in this class ?
 No , but we used to have a gerbil , but Carly L. dropped a book on it .
 Careless .
 Do you need to smell it ?
 No , I 'm smelling for mold . I do n't need to smell it .
 You can smell our parrot .
 You said you did n't have any pets in this class .
 A parrot is a bird .」
narration:[ Cut to House and Foreman eating lunch with some Soap on the TV that has House 's attention more than Foreman does ]

Gregory House:「Parrots are the primary source of psitticosis .
 It 's not the parrot .Psitticosis can lead to nerve problems and neurological complications .
 How many kids were there in the class ?20 .
 How many are home sick ?None , but ...
 None , but you think that 5 year olds are more serious about bird hygiene than their teacher . You 've been through her home ?She lives in Trenton . I can go up to her room tomorrow morning and ask her for the key .
 Would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene ?It 's not a crime scene .
 Far as I know she 's running a Meth Lab out of her basement .She 's a kindergarten teacher !
 And if I was a Kindergarten student I would trust her implicitly . [ Sigh ] Ok , I 'll give you a for instance . The lady back there , who made your egg - salad sandwich . Her eyes look glassy , did you notice that ? Now hospital policy is to stay home if you 're sick , but if you 're making $ 8.00 an hour , then ya kinda need the $ 8.00 an hour right ? The sign in the bathroom says that employees must wash after using the facilities , but I figure that somebody who wipes snot on a sleeve is n't hyper concerned about sanitary conditions . So what do ya think ? Should I trust her ? I want you to check the patient 's home for contaminants , garbage , medication ... [interrupted ]Whoa , oh , I ca n't just break into someone 's house .
 Is n't that how you got into the Felker 's home ? [ pause ] Yeah , I know , court records are sealed , you were 16 , it was a stupid mistake , but your old gym teacher has a big mouth . You should write a thank you note .I should thank him ?
 Well , I needed somebody around here with street smarts . Ok ? Knows when you 're being conned , knows how to con .I should sue you !
 I 'm pretty sure you ca n't sue somebody for wrongful hiring .But I 'm pretty sure I can sue if you fire me for not breaking into some lady 's house .」

narration:[ Foreman eats the rest of the sandwich ]
 [ Cut to House sitting and reading " Spring 's hottest people ' Magazine , Cuddy walks in ]
Gregory House:「I 'm doing research . People are fascinating are n't they ?Why are you giving Adler steroids ?
 Well , she 's my patient that 's what you do with patients . You give them medicine .You do n't prescribe medicine based on guesses . At least we do n't since Tuskeegee and Mengele .
 You 're comparing me to a Nazi ? Nice .I 'm stopping the treatment .
 She 's my patient .It 's my hospital .
 I did not get her sick , she is not an experiment , I have a legitimate theory about what 's wrong with her .With no proof .
 There 's never any proof . 5 different doctors come up with 5 different diagnoses based on the same evidence .You do n't have any evidence . And nobody knows anything huh ? Then how is it that you always assume you 're right ?
 I do n't , I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption . And why are you so afraid of making a mistake ?Because I 'm a doctor . Because when we make mistakes people die .」
narration:[ She walks off up the stairs ]
Gregory House:「Come on .」
narration:[ House thinks about going up the stairs , but decides against it ]

Gregory House:「People used to have more respect for cripples you know ! [ Turns to a guy in a wheelchair ] They did n't really .」
narration:[ Cut to Cuddy entering Rebecca 's room . Rebecca is eating voraciously . ]
 Cuddy ; So , how ya feeling ?
Gregory House:「Much better , thanks . Are you Dr. House ? I thought he was a he , but ... ?
 No . Do n't eat too much too fast .
 Thank him for me .
 Right .」
narration:[ Cuddy exits the room , and House is standing there , Cuddy is a bit surprised by him standing there . ]
Gregory House:「Should I discontinue the treatment , boss ?You got lucky .」
narration:[ She walks off ]
Gregory House:「Cool , huh ?」
narration:[ Cut to the outside of the hospital , and back into Rebecca 's room , it 's now night and Wilson is there ]
Gregory House:「Ok , once again .」
narration:[ Rebecca takes a deep breath ]

Gregory House:「Good .
 Am I ever gon na meet Dr. House ?
 [ scoffs ] Well , you might run into him at the movies or on the bus .
 Is he a good man ?
 He 's a good doctor .
 Can you be one without the other ? Do n't you have to care about people ?
 Caring 's a good motivator . He 's found something else . [ Has Rebecca grab his hands ] Feel this ?
 umhmm
 How about this ?
 umhmm
 Ok squeeze . [ Pause ] Harder . All right .
 He 's your friend , huh ?
 Yeah .
 Does he care about you ?
 I think so .
 You do n't know ?
 As Dr. House likes to say , " Everybody lies . "
 It 's not what people say , it 's what they do .
 [ Pause ] Yes , he cares about me .
 I ca n't see . [ Pause ] I ca n't see .」
narration:[ She starts having a seizure and monitors go crazy ]
Gregory House:「A little help in here !」
narration:[ Flat line on the heart monitor ]
 Commercial , again , evil !
 [ Cut back to Rebecca 's room , daytime , she has an oxygen mask on . Foreman is there ]

Gregory House:「Your chest will be sore for a while . We needed to shock you to get your heart going . Ok . [ He lays a bunch of cards with pictures on them in front of Rebecca ] Can you arrange these to tell a story ?」
narration:[ cut to pictures and then to House 's office ]
Gregory House:「She could n't put them in order .
 Could the damage have been caused by a lack of oxygen during her seizure ?
 No , I gave her the same test 5 minutes later and she did just fine . The altered mental status is intermittent , just like the verbal skills .
 So , what now ?
 Given the latest symptoms it 's clearly growing deeper into the brain stem . Soon she wo n't be able to walk , she 'll go blind permanently , and then the respiratory center will fail .
 How long do we have ?If it 's a tumor we 're talking a month , maybe two , if it 's infectious a few weeks , if it 's vascular that 'll probably be fastest of all , maybe a week .
 We 're gon na stop all treatment .」
narration:[ House gets up and walks over to the drinks . ]

Gregory House:「I still think it 's a tumor . I think we should go back to the radiation .
 She did n't respond to the radiation .
 Well , maybe we did n't see the effects until we started steroids .
 No , it 's not a tumor . The steroids did something , I just do n't know what .So we 're just gon na do nothing ? We 're just gon na watch her die ?
 Yeah , we 're gon na watch her die . Specifically we 're gon na watch how fast she 's dying . You just told us , each diagnosis has its own timeframe . When we see how fast it 's killing her we 'll know what it is .And by then maybe there 's nothing we can do about it .
 There 's go to be something we can do , something better than watching her die .
 Well , I got nothing . How 'bout you ?」
narration:[ Cut to hallway , Foreman and Cameron exit the office ]
Gregory House:「b*st*rd . [ Turns to Cameron ] Oh , Cameron , I need you for a couple of hours .
 What 's up ?
 When you break into someone 's house ; it 's always better to have a white chick with you .
 Adler 's house ? Why do n't we just ask her for a key ?
 For all we know she could be running a meth lab out of her basement .」

narration:[ Cut to clinic and House is with a patient , a guy ]
Gregory House:「I 'm tired a lot .
 Any other reason you think you may have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ?It 's kinda the definition is n't it ?
 It 's kinda the definition of getting older .I had a couple headaches last month , mild fever , sometimes I ca n't sleep , and I have trouble concentrating .
 Apparently not while researching this stuff on the internet .I was thinking it also might be fibromyalgia .
 [ Looks contemplative , and then serious ] Excellent diagnosis [ sarcastic ] !Is there anything for that ?
 [ heavy sigh ] Ya know , I think there just might be .」
narration:[ House goes out of the room , and to the dispensary . ]
Gregory House:「I need 36 Vicodin , and change for a dollar .( jumbled , I ca n't tell )」
narration:[ House gets his change and goes to a candy machine . He gets white candies out of the machine , and goes back to the counter . There he takes the Vicodin and slips them into his pocket , exchanging them for the candy . ]
Gregory House:「Exam room 2 . [ Places the bottle back on the counter . ]」
narration:[SCENE_BREAK]
 [ Cut to Cameron and Foreman in Rebecca 's house ]

Gregory House:「House does n't believe in pretense . Figures life 's too short and too painful . So he just says what he thinks .
 Nothing interesting in the garbage . " I say what I think " is just another way of saying " I 'm an ass . "
 Well , if you wanted to be judged on your medical prowess only , maybe you should n't have broken into someone 's home .
 I was 16 ! Do n't know about ticks , but her dog 's definitely got fleas .
 I managed to make it to 17 without a criminal record .」
narration:[ Foreman is in the fridge , and takes out some ham and mustard ]

Gregory House:「Yeah ? Well you obviously did n't grow up in my neighborhood .
 That 's right . You stole a loaf of bread to feed your starving family right ? You always eat during break - ins ?
 Am I supposed to respect their food more than I respect their DVD players ? You want some ?
 No .
 You gon na go hungry until she dies ?
 No .
 You know what , after centuries of oppression , decades of civil rights marches , and more significantly living like a monk , never getting less than a 4.0 GPA , you do n't think it 's kind of disgusting I get one of the top jobs in the country because I 'm a delinquent ? We 'll eat , then we 'll tear up the carpet .
 You went to Hopkins right ?
 Yep .
 So , you went to a better school than I did , got better grades than I did .
 So how 'd you get the job ? Did you stab a guy in a bar fight ?」
narration:[ Off Cameron 's face , a little disturbed ]
 [ Cut to the hospital exterior , daytime , then into House 's office again ]

Gregory House:「Nothing .
 It 's not a tumor ; she 's getting worse too fast . She ca n't stand up .No toxins , no medication ?
 Nothing that would explain these symptoms .
 Family history of neurological problems ?
 Not that I could tell from her underwear drawer .
 You said nothing that would explain these symptoms . What did you find that does n't explain these symptoms ?Dr. Wilson convinced you to treat this patient under false pretenses . Adler 's not his cousin .
 That 's ridiculous . You can ask her yourself . Can we get back to ... [ interrupted ]
 She 's not Jewish !
 Rachel Adler 's not Jewish ?
 I had ham at her apartment !
 [ chuckles ] Dr. Foreman , a lot of Jews have non - Jewish relatives , and most of us do n't keep kosher . I can see getting through high school without learning a thing about Jews , but medical school ...
 Ok , maybe she 's Jewish , but she 's definitely not your cousin .
 Really ? This guy 's ... he ...
 You do n't even know her name ! You called her Rachel ; her name is Rebecca !
 Yes , yes , her name is Rebecca . I call her Rachel .」
narration:[ While this is going on House is very quiet and you can almost see that he is putting things together }

Gregory House:「You idiot !Hey ... listen ...
 Not you , him ! You said you did n't find anything .Everything I found was in [ interrupted ]
 You found ham .So ?
 Where there 's ham there 's pork , where there 's pork there 's neurocysticercosis .Tapeworm ? ! You think she 's got a worm in her brain ?
 It fits . Could have been living there for years , it never occurred to me [ interrupted ]Millions of people eat ham every day . It 's quite a leap to think that she 's got a tapeworm .
 OK , Mr. Neurologist . What happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm ?They , they get a little better and then they get worse .
 Just like Rebecca Adler did .」
narration:[ Cut out and then in again , House has a book and lays it on the table , open to a page on tapeworms ]

Gregory House:「In a typical case if you do n't cook pork well enough you ingest live tapeworm larvae . They got these little hooks they grab onto your bowel , they live , they grow up , they reproduce .Reproduce ? There 's only got one lesion , and it 's nowhere near her bowel .
 That 's because this is not a typical case . Tapeworm can produce 20 to 30,000 eggs a day . Guess where they go .Out .
 Not all of them . Unlike the larvae , the egg can pass right through the walls of the intestines and into the blood stream . And where does the blood stream go ?Everywhere .
 As long as it 's healthy the immune system does n't even know it 's there . The worm builds a wall , uses secretions to shut down the body 's immune response and control fluid flow . It 's really kinda beautiful .As long as it 's healthy , so what do we do ? Call a vet and nurse the little guy back to health ?
 It 's too late for that . It 's dying , and as it dies this parasite loses the ability to control of the host 's defenses . The immune system wakes up and attacks the worm and everything starts to swell , and that is very bad for the brain .It could still be a hundred other things . The eosinophil count was normal .
 It 's only abnormal in 30 % of cases .
 Proving nothing .
 No , no , no , no , you see , it fits , it 's perfect ! It explains everything .But it proves nothing .
 I can prove it by treating it .No , you ca n't . I was just with her , she does n't want any more treatments , she does n't want any more experiments , she wants to go home and die .」

narration:Commercials ! Gah ! I wish commercials would go home and die !
 [ Cut back into Rebecca 's room , it 's nighttime and House enters ]
Gregory House:「[ To nurse ] Will you excuse us , please ?」
narration:[ Nurse leaves ]
Gregory House:「I 'm Dr. House .It 's good to meet you .
 You 're being an idiot . Ahem . [ Pause ] You have a tapeworm in your brain , it 's not pleasant , but if we do n't do anything you 'll be dead by the weekend .Have you actually seen the worm ?
 When you 're all better I 'll show you my diplomas .You were sure I had vasculitus too . Now I ca n't walk and I 'm wearing a」
narration:diaper . What 's this treatment gon na do for me ?

Gregory House:「I 'm not talking about a treatment ; I 'm talking about a cure . But because I might be wrong , you want to die .What made you a cripple ?
 I had an infarction .A heart attack ?
 It 's what happens when the blood flow is obstructed . If it 's in the heart it 's a heart attack . If it 's in the lungs it 's a pulmonary embolism . If it 's in the brain it 's a stroke . I had it in my thigh muscles .Was n't there something they could do ?
 There was plenty they could do , if they made the right diagnosis , but the only symptom was pain . Not may people get to experience muscle death .Did you think you were dying ?
 I hoped I was dying .So you hide in your office , refuse to see patients because you do n't like the way people look at you . You feel cheated by life so now you 're gon na get even with the world . You want me to fight this . Why ? What makes you think I 'm so much better than you ?
 When you 're scared , you 'll turn into me .I just want to die with a little dignity .
 There 's no such thing ! Our bodies break down , sometimes when we 're 90 , sometimes before we 're even born , but it always happens and there 's never any dignity in it . I do n't care if you can walk , see , wipe your own ass . It 's always ugly , always . [ Pause ] You can live with dignity , we ca n't die with it .」

narration:[ Cut to hallway , outside the room , looks like daytime , but it could be the lights in the hospital . ]
Gregory House:「No treatment .Maybe we can get a court order , override her wishes . Claim she does n't have the capacity to make this decision .
 But she does .But we could claim that the illness made her mentally incompetent .
 Pretty common result .
 That did n't happen here .He 's not gon na do it . She 's not just a file to him anymore . He respects her .
 So because you respect her , you 're going to let her die ?
 I solved the case , my work is done .」
narration:[ House starts to walk away ]
Gregory House:「Patients always want proof , we 're not making cars here , we do n't give guarantees .」
narration:[ House continues walking , Off Chase ]

Gregory House:「I think we can prove it 's a worm . It 's noninvasive , it 's safe . I 'm not completely sure but ... [interrupted ]
 Yeah , yeah , yeah what 's the damn idea ?Have you ever seen a worm under an x - ray , a regular old no contrast 100-year - old technology x - ray ? They light up like shotgun pellets . Just like on a contrast MRI .
 Which is the same thing as a CT scan , which we did , which proved nothing .
 Worm cysts is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid , we 're not going to see anything in her head , but Chase is right , he 's right , we should x - ray her , but we do n't x - ray her brain , we x - ray her leg , worms love thigh muscle . If she 's got one in her head I guarantee you there 's one in her leg .」
narration:[ Cut to x - ray table , Rebecca is on it , and they focus on her leg , x - ray is taken . ]
Gregory House:「Hold still , Rebecca .」
narration:[ ... And the worm shows up . Cut to Rebecca 's hospital room , day . ]

Gregory House:「This here is a worm larva . [ Chase pointing to x - ray of her leg ]
 So , if it 's in my leg , it 's in my brain ?
 Are you looking for a guarantee ? It 's there , probably been there 6 to 10 years .
 Could I have more ?
 Probably . It 's good news .
 What do we do now ?
 Now we get you better . Albendazole .」
narration:[ Hands her a cup with two pills in it . ]
Gregory House:「Two pills ?
 Yeah , every day for at least a month with a meal .
 Two pills ?
 Yeah , possible side effects include abdominal pain , nausea , headache , dizziness , fever , and hair loss . We 'll probably make you keep taking the pills even if you get every one of those .」
narration:[ Rebecca smirks , and then downs the pills ]
 [ Cut to House 's office , day . Cameron 's there waiting as House enters . ]

Gregory House:「Why did you hire me ?
 Does it matter ?Kinda hard to work for a guy who does n't respect you .
 Why ?Is that rhetorical ?
 No , it just seems that way because you ca n't think of an answer . Does it make a difference why I think I 'm a jerk ? The only thing that matters is what you think . Can you do the job ?You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record .
 No , it was n't a racial thing , I did n't see a black guy . I just saw a doctor ... with a juvenile record . I hired Chase 'cause his dad made a phone call . I hired you because you are extremely pretty .You hired me to get into my pants ? !
 I ca n't believe that that would shock you . It 's also not what I said . No , I hired you because you look good ; it 's like having a nice piece of art in the lobby .I was in the top of my class .
 But not THE top .I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic .
 Yes , you were a very good applicant .But not the best ?
 Would that upset you , really , to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty not some genetic gift of intelligence ?I worked very hard to get where I am .
 But you did n't have to . People choose the paths that gain them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort . That 's a law of nature , and you defied it . That 's why I hired you . You could have married rich , could have been a model , you could have just shown up and people would have given you stuff . Lots of stuff , but you did n't , you worked your stunning little ass off .Am I supposed to be flattered ?
 Gorgeous women do not go to medical school . Unless they 're as damaged as they are beautiful . Were you abused by a family member ?No !
 Sexually assaulted ?No .
 But you are damaged , are n't you ?」

narration:[ Cameron hesitates , and in that moment her pager goes off ]
Gregory House:「I have to go .」
narration:[ She leaves , cut to orange guy
 not so orange now
 in with Cuddy ]
Gregory House:「I followed her . I could n't stop thinking about what that doctor said .
 I told you not to listen to him , he 's an idiot .
 I was ORANGE .
 I do n't want to know what you found out .
 You do n't care ?
 I 'm your doctor , you 've been good to me and good to this hospital , of course I care , but I do n't see how this conversation can end well for me . Either your wife is having an affair , or she 's not having an affair and you have come here because you rightly think I should fire him , but I ca n't even if it cost me your money , the son of a bitch is the best doctor we have .」
narration:[ Cut to his finger , now missing his ring ]
 [ Cut to Rebecca 's room , Chase enters ]
Gregory House:「Feeling any better ?
 I ca n't complain .
 As you know the hospital has certain rules , and as you also know we tend to ignore them , but I think this one 's gon na be a little obvious unless we get your help .」
narration:[ Cameron enters with Rebecca 's class ]

Gregory House:「If anyone asks , you have 11 daughters and 5 sons .
 Hi , you guys !
 Hi !
 Come here !」
narration:[ They gather around her bed and present her with a card . ]
Gregory House:「It 's so good to see you guys ! I missed you ! Is this for me ?」
narration:[ Rebecca opens it and inside it says " Miss Rebecca we 're glad you 're not dead " ]
Gregory House:「Oh , I love you guys . [ To Chase and Cameron ] I wanted to thank Dr. House , but he never visited again .
 He cured you , you did n't cure him .
 [ Talking to class ] Ok , I want a hug and a kiss from every single one of you . Get up here right now !
 [ Giggles , and laughs ]」
narration:[ They get up on the bed with Rebecca ]
 [ Cut to House watching General Hospital
 I assume
 ]

Gregory House:「There .
 Hold on .
 She 's converted .
 You said she was your cousin . Why would you lie ?It got you to take the case .
 You lied to a friend to save a stranger , you do n't think that 's screwed up ?You 've never lied to me ?
 I NEVER lie .Oh , really .
 Why do we do this ?
 Because we 're doctors , when we make mistakes people die .
 Cuddy using the same line earlier ]」
narration:[ Knock on the door ]
Gregory House:「Dr. House ? You have a patient .」
narration:[ Nurse pulls the blinds away to reveal the guy that House gave the candy pills to . ]
Gregory House:「He says he needs a refill .
 Got change for a dollar ?」
narration:[ Cut to outside the hospital and aerial view of the campus . ]
Gregory House:「" No , you ca n't always get what you want . " " You ca n't always get what you want . "」
