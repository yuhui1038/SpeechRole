 The closet is mostly empty now, the bed overflowing with discarded clothes. Mattie Fae nurses a cocktail, hands a

Violet Weston:「Look at me. (shows photo to Ivy) Look at me.」
IVY:「You're beautiful, Mom.」
Violet Weston:「I was beautiful. Not anymore.」
narrator:MATTIE FAE
 IVY Oh, now --
 You're still beautiful.
Violet Weston:「One of those lies we tell to give us comfort. Women are beautiful when they're young and not after. Men can still preserve their sex appeal into old age. Not those men like you see with shorts and those little purses around their waists. Some men can maintain a weary masculinity. Women just get old and fat and wrinkly.」

Violet Weston:「You're about as sexy as a wet card- board box, Mattie Fae, you and me both. Look, wouldn't we be better off if we stopped lying about these things and told the truth? "Women aren't sexy when they're old." I can live with that. Can you live with that?」
MATTIE FAE:「What about Sophia Loren? What about Lena Horne? She stayed sexy till she was eighty.」

Violet Weston:「Oh sure. I never told them I knew. But your father knew. He knew I knew. But we never talked about it. I chose the higher ground.

If I'd reached him at that motel, I would've said, "You'd be better off if you quit sulking about this ancient history."」
BARBARA:「what motel?」

Violet Weston:「I called over there on Monday after I got into that safety deposit box. But it was too late, he'd checked out.」
