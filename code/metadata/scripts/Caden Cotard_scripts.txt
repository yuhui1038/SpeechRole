Caden Cotard:「Can I piss in your sink?」
ADELE:「Um, yeah, I guess. Caden pisses in the sink in the corner of the studio. His urine is amber. He finishes and peeks over Adele's shoulder, through the magnifying glass at the painting. It's an amazingly detailed and angrily colored painting of a woman in a state of profound despair, screaming to the heavens, while standing in a field of flames.」

Caden Cotard:「Why didn't you tell me that before?」
HAZEL:「Caden. I don't want to say things that are going to make you sad.」
Caden Cotard:「It mostly makes me sad that it doesn't make you sad.」
HAZEL:「You want me to be sad that someone's taking me out to dinner? I don't know how to do that.」
Caden Cotard:「I want you to be sad that we had something really special and it's going away!」

 How can you be like that?」
TAMMY:「I get undressed every day.」
Caden Cotard:「In front of someone is different.」
TAMMY:「I don't see why.」
Caden Cotard:「Maybe because you have a beautiful body. Maybe that makes it easier.」
TAMMY:「I suppose it might. Do you want to fuck?」
Caden Cotard:「I do. Yes. Um. Do you?」

SAMMY:「Jeremy is playing to us. Tell him he simply needs to talk to Donna. We'll hear what we hear. Tammy takes down the note.」
Caden Cotard:「Sammy's explaining too much. Feels expository. Needs to be shorthand, like, "Jeremy big." Hazel writes that down. They all continue down the hall.」

There follows a slightly delayed and staticky translation, in an accented male voice, of everything Olive says, with a delay between what Caden says and Olive's response, as she listens in translation.
OLIVE:「I'm dying, as I'm sure Maria told you. The flower tattoos have become infected and they're dying. So I am, as well. This is life. Olive pulls down her hospital gown a bit to show Caden the now sickly and decayed flower tattoos.」

 EXT. NYC STREET - SUMMER 2045 - DAY175
 It's sweltering. Caden sits on his stoop, holding some dead flower petals, watching the world pass by. People are sick, angry. Some people wear gas masks. Government vehicles with strange symbols and gun turrets drive by. A woman walks a naked man on a leash. He defecates on the sidewalk. A wild- eyed man in a white t-shirt and Santa hat attacks Caden. As he knocks Caden to the ground and wrestles with him, Caden sees the t-shirt has a little dot: a painting from Adele's show. It's a moment in time, a street scene very much like the one Caden's in. In the painting, a man in a white t- shirt and Santa hat beats up a man who looks like Caden. The flower petals blow away. Caden tries to limp after them.

 Caden weeps inconsolably at the director's table, Michael the pre-Hazel assistant is back, neat and efficient-looking, but old now. Hazel's dog, Squishy, sleeps on the floor. The scene in the play is dull. People walk back and forth aimlessly. Various passersby on the street have hacking coughs. Tammy steps out of the bathroom, meanders over to the director's table. Hazel's sweater is on Michael's chair- back. She casually pulls it off and tries it on. Caden watches. She looks so much like Hazel now, it's unbearable. He looks away. Millicent walks by carrying a mop and bucket.
