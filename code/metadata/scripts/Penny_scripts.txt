:「''(Penny turns and crosses hall.)''」
Leonard:「Okay, well, goodnight. ''(Leans in to kiss Leslie.)''」
Penny:「Okay, well, goodnight. ''(Grabs Eric and kisses him more passionately.)''」
Leslie:「''(Whispering)'' That ain’t going to make your point. ''(Grabs him and tries to out-passion Penny. The two couples get more passionate trying to outdo each other until Leonard grabs Leslie’s ass.)'' Okay, that's enough. ''(Sweetly)'' Call me ''(exits.)''」
Leonard:「Right ''(goes back inside flat. Closes door.)''」
Penny:「''(Breaking off kiss)'' Okay, goodnight.」
Eric:「What?」
Penny:「Had a great time, ciao ''(closes door.)''」


Leonard:「I think we’re all talking to Penny here.」
Sheldon:「I'm not. No offence.」
Kurt:「Okay, maybe you didn't hear me, go away.」
Penny:「Alright Kurt, be nice.」
Kurt:「Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.」
Penny:「Kurt!」
Leonard:「Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery.」
Kurt:「Are you calling me a puffy animal?」
Penny:「Of course not, no, he's not, you're not, right Leonard?」


Sheldon:「Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.」
Leonard:「Oh, right, right right right right.」
Howard:「Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it.」
Leonard:「''(Exiting to hallway)'' Penny, the mail man did it again, he... ''(looks up to see Penny kissing a hunky man)'' Oh! Sorry.」
Penny:「Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard.」
[[Doug]]:「What's up bro?」
Leonard:「Not much. Bro.」
Penny:「Is, is everything okay.」
Leonard:「Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.」
Penny:「Thank you, I’ve got to talk to that mail man.」
Leonard:「Oh no, that's probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap.」
Penny:「Okay, well, thank you, again.」


Raj:「Okay, we’re all set.」
Howard:「Let her rip.」
:「''(Leonard turns on stereo with a remote. Rhythmic bass-heavy music plays. The liquid begins dancing on the speaker.)''」
Penny:「''(Entering, carrying a laptop)'' Hi!」
Leonard:「Hey, check it out, it's just corn starch and water.」
Sheldon:「They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.」
Howard:「That's what makes it get all funky.」
Penny:「Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.」
Howard:「''(After Raj whispers in his ear)'' No, that's what she said, Sheldon.」
Penny:「Okay, look, I bought the game, and I’ve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.」
Sheldon:「Do you have the enchanted sword?」
Penny:「No, no, I’ve a bronze dagger.」
Sheldon:「You can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it's like the car key in your apartment door all over again.」
Penny:「Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?」
Sheldon:「Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?」
Penny:「Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?」
Sheldon:「No, no, no, it's... oh for God's sakes, gimme. ''(Takes laptop.)''」
Penny:「Thank you, I really appreciate this.」
Sheldon:「You're going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny.」
Penny:「Don't patronize me, just get the sword.」


'''Scene''':「''The hallway, Leonard puts a note under Penny’s door. It opens.''」
Penny:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Oh.」
Penny:「What's going on?」
Leonard:「Um, here's the thing. ''(Reads from note.)'' Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognize one's mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie’s discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research….」
Penny:「Leonard.」
Leonard:「Yeah.」
Penny:「''(Hugs him)'' We’re okay. ''(Kisses him on cheek. Closes door. Leonard looks happy, walks back across hallway and straight into the apartment door.)''」


'''Scene''':「''[[The Cheesecake Factory]]. Raj and Sheldon are arm wrestling while playing tetris. There is a cacophony of cries such as “take him down” and “he’s got you, Sheldon.”''」
Penny:「Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.」
Leonard:「Oh, it's called trestling.」
Howard:「It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport.」
Penny:「Yeah, that's terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out. ''(To someone off)'' Right come on guys, come on. ''(Singing while approaching another table)'' Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...」
Sheldon:「We might as well stop, it's a stalemate. You're beating me in tetris, but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.」
Raj:「Keebler Elf? I’ve got your Keebler Elf right here. ''(Strains to push Sheldon’s arm down. Tries using both hands, still with no effect.)'' Okay, it's a stalemate.」
Penny:「So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?」
Sheldon:「He can't eat cheesecake, he's lactose intolerant.」
Penny:「Okay, he can have carrot cake.」
Sheldon:「What about the cream cheese frosting.」
Penny:「he can scrape it off.」
Leonard:「Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?」
Penny:「I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody's until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.」
Sheldon:「For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum.」
Penny:「Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?」
Leonard:「Oh, I don't think so.」
Penny:「Why not?」
Leonard:「I don't celebrate my birthday.」
Penny:「Shuddup, yeah you do.」
Leonard:「No, it's no big deal, it's just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.」
Penny:「Uh, that's so silly.」
Sheldon:「It's actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it.」
Penny:「What was it called, “I hate my son and that’s why he can’t have cake?”」
Sheldon:「It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas he'd be a little better at it.」
Leonard:「Thank you.」
Howard:「Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom's special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends.」
Penny:「Yeah, see, that's what kids should have.」
Howard:「Actually that was last year.」
Penny:「So you've really never had a birthday party?」
Leonard:「No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favorite.」
Penny:「And?」
Leonard:「Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died.」
Penny:「Oh my God, that's terrible.」
Leonard:「Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so...7」
Penny:「That's the saddest thing I’ve ever heard.」


Sheldon:「No. We’re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.」
Toby:「Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?」
Sheldon:「Subtextually, of course. ''(There is a knock on the door.)'' Just have fun with it. ''(Opening door.)'' Morning Penny.」
Penny:「Hi. How did the intervention go.」
Sheldon:「Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.」
Penny:「Well, based on what you told me, I'm not surprised.」
Sheldon:「But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbor.」
Penny:「Hi Leo, how are you feeling?」
Toby:「Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?」
Penny:「No.」
Toby:「Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.」
Leonard:「Well, that's Leo. Hey, um, why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?」
Penny:「Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn't a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.」
Leonard:「There were only two people there?」
Penny:「By the end. Yeah.」
Toby:「Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan!」
Penny:「I'm... I'm sorry.」


'''Scene''':「''A restaurant.''」
Penny:「So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?」
Leonard:「Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.」
Penny:「Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.」
Leonard:「You're kidding, well, then, that's something we have in common.」
Penny:「How?」
Leonard:「We both have people in our lives who... want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.」
Penny:「So, what's new in the world of physics?」
Leonard:「Nothing.」
Penny:「Really, nothing?」
Leonard:「Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930s, and you can't prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”」
Penny:「Ah. Well I'm sure things will pick up.」
Leonard:「What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?」
Penny:「Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well.」
Leonard:「Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.」
Penny:「Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, you know, he's nice and funny, but...」
Waitress:「Can I get you started with some drinks?」
Leonard:「No, ''(waves her away)'' You were saying, but...」
Penny:「I'd like a drink.」
Leonard:「Just say the but thing about Doug and then I'll get her back.」
Penny:「Okay, well, you know, it's just me. I'm still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.」
Leonard:「Ugh, don't get me started on rebound sex.」
Penny:「It's just, it's my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it's just thirty six meaningless hours of... well, you know.」
Leonard:「I'm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one... glorious summer.」
Penny:「No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.」
Leonard:「Well, chafing, right?」
Penny:「Emotionally.」
Leonard:「Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool? ''(Penny nods.)'' I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.」
Penny:「How?」
Leonard:「Physics. ''(He places the glass over the olive and spins it until the olive gets caught up on the side)''.」
Penny:「Wow, centrifugal force!」
Leonard:「Actually, it's centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive.'' (The olive drops.)'' Excuse me. ''(Leonard disappears under table.)''Now, if you were riding on the olive, you'd be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would ''(he bangs his head on the underside of the table.)''」
Penny:「Are you okay?」
Leonard:「Yeah, I'm okay. Did you spill ketchup?」
Penny:「No.」


Leonard:「You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize. ''(Sheldon laughs.)'' What's funny?」
Sheldon:「That wasn't sarcasm?」
Leonard:「No.」
Sheldon:「Whoo, boy, you are all over the place this morning. ''(Knocks on Penny’s door.)'' I have a masters and two PhD's, I should not have to do this.」
Penny:「''(Opening door)'' What?」


Sheldon:「Considering what? How great this place looks?」
Howard:「align="left" |''(Across room with Raj)'' Oh boy, I was afraid of this.」
Leonard:「What?」
Howard:「These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.」
Penny:「Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.」


'''Scene''':「''In the bathroom.''」
Leonard:「Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I'm sorry.」
Penny:「Okay. Thanks.」
Leonard:「You're welcome, oh, you're going to step right, okay, I'll....」
Penny:「Hey, Leonard?」
Leonard:「The hair products are Sheldon's.」
Penny:「Um, okay. Can I ask you a favor?」
Leonard:「A favor? Sure, you can ask me a favor, I would do you a favor for you.」
Penny:「It's okay if you say no.」
Leonard:「Oh, I'll probably say yes.」
Penny:「It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you've just met.」


Warrior:「Hello, fair Penny.」
Penny:「Who are you?」
Warrior:「It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz. Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing, followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern?」
Penny:「Yeah, sure, why not?」
Penny:「Oh my God, I need help. ''(Closes laptop and throws it away.)''」


Leonard:「At least I didn't have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.」
Sheldon:「I didn't invent them, they're there.」
Leonard:「In what universe?」
Sheldon:「In all of them, that is the point.」
Penny:「Uh, do you guys mind if I start?」
Sheldon:「Um, Penny... that's where I sit.」
Penny:「So, sit next to me.」
Sheldon:「... No, I sit there.」
Penny:「What's the difference?」
Sheldon:「"What’s the difference"?」
Leonard:「Here we go.」
Sheldon:「In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion. I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point.」
Penny:「Do you want me to move?」


'''Scene''':「''The stairwell of the apartment building.''」
Penny:「Are you sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?」
Leonard:「No, no, I'm okay, it's stopped bleeding.」
Penny:「I know, but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a concussion?」
Leonard:「Yes, but I get car sick too, so...」
Penny:「Okay.」
Leonard:「Sorry about your car, by the way.」
Penny:「Oh, no, it's fine, you got most of it out the window.」
Leonard:「The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.」
Penny:「Yeah, me too. Well, um, good night. ''(Leonard turns across hallway.)'' Leonard?」
Leonard:「Yeah.」
Penny:「Was this supposed to be a date?」
Leonard:「This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.」
Penny:「Okay, I was just checking.」


Howard:「Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.」
Raj:「I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?」
Leonard:「No, that's Marcie. Peppermint Patty's just athletic.」
Sheldon:「There you go, one enchanted sword.」
Penny:「Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. ''(Leaves)''.」


Leonard:「Why at my place?」
Lesley:「Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.」
Penny:「Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello?」
Leonard:「Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.」
Howard:「If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.」
Penny:「Really? ''(Howard performs some of the worst beatboxing imaginable.)'' I'm actually not that into music. So hey, your friend's really cute, anything going on with you two.」
Leonard:「Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?」
Sheldon:「He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure.」
Leonard:「Thank you Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Oh, I'm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?」
Penny:「Oh, that's too bad, you guys would make a cute couple.」


Howard:「Oh yeah.」
Mary Cooper:「Okay. Alright everybody, it's time to eat. ''(Everybody begins to do so)'' Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker. ''(To Raj and Howard)'' Now after a moment of silent meditation I'm going to end with “In Jesus’ Name” but you two don't feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you.」
Penny:「Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I’ve ever had.」
Mary Cooper:「It was always Sheldon’ s favorite. You know what the secret ingredient is?」
Penny:「Love?」


Leonard:「Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.」
Sheldon:「Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation.」
Leonard:「Really?」
Sheldon:「Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can't grow soup.」
Penny:「So, how's everything.」
Sheldon:「Terrific, you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.」
Penny:「Really, oh yay!」
Sheldon:「Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?」
Penny:「Um, I don't know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley?」
Leonard:「Oh, to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out.」
Penny:「Oh, oh that's too bad. Well hey, don't worry, I'm sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. ''(Walks away smiling)''.」


'''Scene''':「''An electronics store.''」
Penny:「Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.」
Sheldon:「Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner.」
Penny:「Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn't buy for themselves.」
Sheldon:「You mean, like a sweater?」
Penny:「Well, it's a fun sweater, it's got a bold geometric print.」
Sheldon:「Is it the geometry that makes it fun.」
Penny:「Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.」
Sheldon:「Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.」
Penny:「Exactly.」


'''Scene''':「''Outside [[Apartment 4B]].''」
Penny:「''(opening door)'' Oh, hey guys, what's up?」
Howard:「We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.」
Penny:「What?」


'''Scene''':「''Outside Penny’s door. Leonard knocks.''」
Penny:「''(Answering)'' Oh, hey guys, what's up?」
Sheldon:「It's Halo night.」
Penny:「Yeah. Okay. So?」
Leonard:「Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy,」
Penny:「She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.」
Leonard:「Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?」
Sheldon:「Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.」
Penny:「Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.」
Sheldon:「You can't go out, it's Halo night.」
Penny:「Well, for Penny it's dancing night.」
Sheldon:「You go dancing every Wednesday?」
Penny:「No.」
Sheldon:「Then it's not dancing night.」
Penny:「Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?」
Sheldon:「Tonight is Halo night! It's like talking to a wall.」
Penny:「Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.」
Leonard:「Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.」
Sheldon:「Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.」
Penny:「Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.」


Leonard:「When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.」
Sheldon:「Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man's closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.」
Leonard:「What were you doing in his closet?」
Sheldon:「I helped him run some cable for a webcam.」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' Hey guys.」
Leonard:「Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.」
Penny:「Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?」


Sheldon:「Oh, God, now even you're smarter than me.」
Howard:「You know, Sheldon, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.」
Leonard:「Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.」
Sheldon:「Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.」
Penny:「I'm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?」
Leonard:「You can't let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.」
Sheldon:「Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.」
Penny:「So, you've got a bit of competition, I really don't see what the big deal is.」
Sheldon:「Well of course you don't, you've never excelled at anything.」
Penny:「I don't understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?」
Howard:「We liked Leonard.」
Leonard:「Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?」
Sheldon:「Yes. That's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.」
Penny:「You know, I'm confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?」


Sheldon:「We could put her stereo back there.」
Leonard:「And control it how?」
Sheldon:「Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.」
Howard:「align="left" |''(After Raj whispers in his ear)'' Good point, how you gonna cool it?」
Penny:「Hey guys, I got this.」
Sheldon:「Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?」
Leonard:「Also inefficient, and might be loud.」
Howard:「How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC...」
Penny:「Guys, this is actually really simple.」
Howard:「Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.」
Leonard:「Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?」
Sheldon:「And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.」
Penny:「Guys, it's hot in here, I think I'll just take off all my clothes.」


Leonard:「Yeah.」
Raj:「It's bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.」
Leonard:「Terrific.」
Raj:「It has more food too.」
Penny:「Alright, come on, come on.」


'''Scene''':「''Outside Penny’s door.''」
Sheldon:「''(Knock, knock, knock, knock)'' Penny, ''(Knock, knock, knock, knock)'' Penny, ''(Knock, knock, knock, knock)'' Penny, ''(door opens)'' Good morning.」
Penny:「Do you have any idea what time it is?」
Sheldon:「Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It's accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I'm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.」
Penny:「What do you want?」
Sheldon:「Remember how Leonard told you we couldn't come to your performance because we were attending a [http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Seminar_on_Molecular_Positronium Symposium on Molecular Positronium]?」
Penny:「I remember symposium.」
Sheldon:「Yes, well, he lied.」
Penny:「Wait, what?」
Sheldon:「He lied, and I'm feeling very uncomfortable about it.」
Penny:「Well imagine how I'm feeling.」


'''Scene''':「''Apartment 4B''」
Leonard:「''(Knocking and entering)'' I'm back.」
Penny:「I'm sorry I yelled at you. It's not your fault.」
Leonard:「What happened?」
Penny:「Well, I went over to Mike's to make up with him.」
Leonard:「Yeah, I know, I know that part.」
Penny:「But he had already moved on.」
Leonard:「Already, that was quick.」
Penny:「That's what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck.」
Leonard:「Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.」
Penny:「How could he do that.」
Leonard:「Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod... yeah, no, how could he do that.」
Penny:「I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money.」
Leonard:「Yeah, that must get old quick.」
Penny:「You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me.」
Leonard:「What about me?」
Penny:「What about you what?」
Leonard:「What about if you went out with me?」
Penny:「Are you asking me out?」
Leonard:「Um... yes... I am... asking you out.」
Penny:「Wow.」
Leonard:「I was just going off your comment about the nice guy...」
Penny:「No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally.」
Leonard:「''(Continuing through Penny)'' ...thing and honest but, it's no big deal...」
Penny:「Yes.」
Leonard:「Yes what?」
Penny:「Yes, I will go out with you.」
Leonard:「Really?」
Penny:「Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?」


Leonard:「I don't know what to say.」
Howard:「Wow.」
Leonard:「Howard, listen...」
Howard:「No, it's okay, it's your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.」
Penny:「Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.」
Sheldon:「Okay, sure. I don't see a problem with that.」
Penny:「There's no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn't that right Leonard.」
Leonard:「Well... I don't know what to say.」
Penny:「It's okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm...ian」
Sheldon:「Good for you.」
Penny:「Hah, yeah! Because he didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.」
Howard:「''(After Raj whispers in his ear)'' No, I'm lost too, I think she skipped a step.」
Penny:「No, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family's going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he's such a good man.」
Leonard:「Oh, another hug, thank you.」
Penny:「Alright you guys, good luck.」


Leonard:「Why not?」
Howard:「Becauth ''(pretends tongue has swollen up)'' Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water.」
Leonard:「Alright, I’ll be right back.」
Howard:「''(Into phone)'' Penny, look, I’ve got a problem.」
Penny:「''(With Sheldon in background at the head of a large queue of customers)'' Yeah, well so do I, look you’ve got to stall Leonard a little longer.」
Howard:「I don’t think I can.」
Penny:「You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell “surprise!”」
Howard:「Okay, you have to understand something, we’re in a hospital right now.」
Penny:「Why, is Leonard okay.」
Howard:「Leonard's fine. I'm fine, thanks for asking, by the way.」
Penny:「Okay, I don't need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer.」
Howard:「Look, I’ve done my best but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him.」
Penny:「Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I'll point out which of my friends are easy.」
Howard:「Don't toy with me, woman.」
Penny:「I’ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I’ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who's two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.」


Warrior:「Hey Penny, it's me again, Leonard.」
Penny:「Leonard, I said not now.」
Leonard:「Yeah, I know, I'm just a little concerned about you.」
Penny:「I said not now. ''(Chops off his head.)''」


'''Scene''':「''The hallway, Sheldon scuttles out of apartment door and crosses to Penny’s. Knocks on it urgently.''」
Penny:「''(Opening door)'' Oh, hey Sheldon, what's going on?」
Sheldon:「I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.」
Penny:「I'm sorry?」
Sheldon:「Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols &ndash; it's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.」
Penny:「Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaining yourself, but you're really not.」
Sheldon:「Just come with me.」
Sheldon:「Well?」
Penny:「Well what?」
Sheldon:「What does it mean?」
Penny:「Oh, come on, you went to college.」
Sheldon:「Yes, but I was eleven.」
Penny:「Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because they're, you know, getting busy.」
Sheldon:「So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there.」
Penny:「Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.」
Lesley:「''(Voice off)'' Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast.」
Penny:「We really shouldn't be standing here.」
Sheldon:「''(Entering living room)'' This is very awkward.」
Penny:「Oh, come on, you know, Leonard's had girls over before, right?」
Sheldon:「Oh, yes, but there's usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.」
Penny:「Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?」
Sheldon:「I didn't have to, the dates just happened to coincide.」
Penny:「So, do you know who's in there?」
Sheldon:「Well, there's Leonard. ''(Picking up violin case)'' And he's either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930s gangster.」
Penny:「Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.」
Sheldon:「No, no, wait, hold on.」
Penny:「What's the matter?」
Sheldon:「I don't know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?」
Penny:「Gee, Sheldon, you're asking the wrong girl. I'm usually on the other side of the tie.」


Toby:「This is amazing. Just sitting on a couch, watching TV with a woman. Not being drunk, or high, or... or... wondering if you're a dude down there.」
Penny:「Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You're gonna do okay.」


Sheldon:「It depends on what Bus you have.」
Guy:「I drive a Chevy Cavalier.」
Sheldon:「Oh, dear lord.」
Penny:「Sheldon, we have to go.」


'''Scene''':「''Apartment 4A''」
Penny:「Good afternoon, and welcome to today's physics bowl practice round. I'm Penny, and I'll be your host, because apparently I didn't have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn't that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?」
Leonard:「Yes.」
Sheldon:「Of course.」
Howard:「Fire away. ''(Raj puts his thumb up.)''」
Penny:「You know, it's none of my business, but isn't a guy who can't speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?」
Leonard:「Oh, uh, he'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they're one on one and smell nice.」
Penny:「Oh, thanks Raj, it's vanilla oil.」
Leonard:「I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let's just start.」
Penny:「Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.」
Sheldon:「And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.」
Penny:「That is correct.」
Leonard:「I knew that too.」
Penny:「Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.」
Sheldon:「And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.」
Penny:「Right.」


'''Scene''':「[[Apartment 4A]]. Sheldon is on the sofa, using his laptop. He is wearing a headset.」
Sheldon:「Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel's fortress. Now this is a long run, so let's do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we'll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor. ''(There is banging at the door.)''Sheldor is AFK. ''(Goes out to find Penny having trouble getting into her apartment.)'' Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?」
Penny:「Yes, I can't get my stupid door open.」
Sheldon:「You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?」
Penny:「Yeah!」
Sheldon:「Alright then. ''(Turns to return inside. One of the grocery bags Penny is holding falls to the floor spilling groceries.)''」
Penny:「Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.」
Sheldon:「Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?」
Penny:「I can't get the damned key out.」
Sheldon:「Well that's not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagen uses a center cylinder system.」
Penny:「Thank you, Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「You're welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?」
Penny:「Why? I'll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?」
Sheldon:「Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure....」
Penny:「I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven't got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven't gotten a raise at work, haven't even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.」
Sheldon:「Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they're almost pure protein.」
Penny:「''(Picking up the bag she has just repacked, whereupon the bottom falls out and the groceries fall to the floor again)'' Oh, sonofabitch!」
Sheldon:「I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.」
Penny:「I did, and he said he'll get here when he gets here.」
Sheldon:「And you're frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?」
Penny:「No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like flies! ''(Bursts into tears.)''」
Sheldon:「There there. ''(Reluctantly)'' Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?」
Penny:「No Sheldon, I'd rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three-year-old.」
Sheldon:「Alright then. ''(Turns to go inside again.)''」
Penny:「For God's sake! ''(Stomps into apartment.)''」


'''Scene''':「''Leonard’s bedroom. Penny is looking through his closet.''」
Penny:「So, how's it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other?」
Leonard:「Not only is he still not talking to me, but there's this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? ''(Put’s fingers to head)'' You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, “I know my physics, but I’m still a fun guy!”」
Penny:「Oh, hey, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits!」
Leonard:「They don't, that's why I saved this one.」
Penny:「Okay, well, let's just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.」
Leonard:「Is this all stuff you want me to try on?」
Penny:「No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.」
Leonard:「Oh.」
Penny:「Seriously, don't even give it to charity, you won't be helping anyone. What's this.」
Leonard:「Oh, that's the bottled city of Kandor.」
Penny:「Uh-huh.」
Leonard:「You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.」
Penny:「Oh, nice.」
Leonard:「It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.」
Penny:「Here, why don't you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match.」
Leonard:「Great, be right back.」
Penny:「Well, where you going, just put them on.」
Leonard:「Here?」
Penny:「Oh, are you shy?」
Leonard:「No, I'm not shy.」
Penny:「Don't worry, I won't look.」
Leonard:「I know you won't look, why would you look, there's nothing to see, well, not nothing....」
Penny:「Sweetie, put the pants on.」
Leonard:「Putting them on.」
Penny:「So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.」
Leonard:「No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesize facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy.」
Penny:「What is this?」
Leonard:「Oh, careful. That's my original series "[[Battlestar Galatica]]" flight suit.」
Penny:「Oh, why didn't you wear it at Halloween?」
Leonard:「Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.」
Penny:「Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.」
Leonard:「Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.」
Penny:「If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your... your only tie?」
Leonard:「Ah. Technically yes, but, if you'll notice, it's reversible. So it works as two.」
Penny:「Oh, sweetie, I don't think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?」
Leonard:「Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.」
Penny:「The... the eighth grade?」
Leonard:「My last growth spurt.」
Penny:「Okay, well, I guess we’re back to the corduroy suit.」
Leonard:「Great.」
Penny:「Yup. ''(Leonard picks up paisley shirt)'' I said no, put it down.」


Sheldon:「No?」
Leonard:「No.」
Sheldon:「No.」
Leonard:「It's right down the hall.」
Penny:「Thanks. You guys are really sweet.」


'''Scene''':「''The hallway. Leonard knocks on Penny’s door.''」
Penny:「''(Opening door)'' Ah, hey Leonard.」
Leonard:「Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh... I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.」
Penny:「Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?」
Leonard:「There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.」
Penny:「Supper?」
Leonard:「Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.」
Penny:「Uh, six thirty's great.」
Leonard:「Really? Great!」
Penny:「Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.」
Leonard:「Us guys?」
Penny:「You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all's coming?」
Leonard:「They.... might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quiznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn't, it's no fault of Quiznos, they have a varied menu.」
Penny:「Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.」
Leonard:「Great. Did we say a time?」
Penny:「Six thirty.」
Leonard:「And that's still good for you.」
Penny:「It's fine.」
Leonard:「Cos it's not carved in stone.」
Penny:「No, six thirty's great.」
Leonard:「I'll get my chisel.」
Penny:「Why?」


Raj:「Oh, okay, Leonard?」
Leonard:「Well, uh, no I... the... no.」
Raj:「Sheldon?」
Sheldon:「I can make it, but I won't.」
Penny:「What are you guys talking about?」
Raj:「Well, there's a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.」
Penny:「And you guys aren't going? I can't believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you're not even going to be there to support him?」
Sheldon:「A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.」
Howard:「That would be cool. I'd go to that reception.」
Penny:「Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn't even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.」
Raj:「Would you like to go with me?」
Penny:「Of course I would, I would be honored.」
Raj:「Really? Cool.」
Penny:「Shame on you guys. (Leaves)」


''Scene'':「Outside Penny's door. Raj in a suit knocks on the door with his foot as he has a glass of champagne in both hands. He drinks one. Penny opens door, she is dressed up also.」
Penny:「Oh, Raj, look at you!」
Raj:「I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?」
Penny:「Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren't you?」
Raj:「It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you're getting ready.」
Penny:「Oh, I'm ready.」
Raj:「That's what you're wearing.」
Penny:「Um, yeah, why what's wrong with it?」
Raj:「Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.」
Penny:「Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you're gonna get.」
Raj:「Okey dokey, let's roll. Alright, it's time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh.」
Penny:「Hey Leonard.」
Leonard:「Hey.」
Raj:「Dude.」
Leonard:「You look very nice.」
Raj:「Thank you.」
Penny:「Uh, come on, good night Leonard.」


Leonard:「No.」
Sheldon:「Good. There there was really all I had.」
Leonard:「Good night Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Good night Leonard.」
Penny:「''(Knocking on door and entering)'' Hey Leonard.」
Leonard:「Hi Penny.」
Penny:「Hey, I just wanted to make sure you're okay.」
Leonard:「I'm fine.」
Penny:「I'm so sorry about what happened.」
Leonard:「It's not your fault.」
Penny:「Yes it is. That's why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.」
Leonard:「So why was he at your party?」
Penny:「Well, I ran into him last week and, he was...  just, all apologetic, about how he's changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and... I can't go back to my party because he's there, and I know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to... ''(bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard’s shoulder.)''」
Leonard:「There there.」
Penny:「God, what is wrong with me.」
Leonard:「Nothing, you're perfect.」
Penny:「Gah, I'm not perfect.」
Leonard:「Yes you are.」
Penny:「You really think so, don't you? ''(She kisses hm.)''」
Leonard:「Penny?」
Penny:「Yeah.」
Leonard:「How much have you had to drink tonight?」
Penny:「Just.... a lot.」
Leonard:「Are you sure that you're being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?」
Penny:「It might. Boy, you're really smart.」
Leonard:「Yeah, I'm a frickin’ genius.」
Penny:「Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you?」
Leonard:「Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.」
Penny:「I should probably go.」
Leonard:「Probably.」
Penny:「''(In doorway)'' Thank you. ''(She kisses him again. Kurt is watching.)''」


Sheldon:「True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?」
Leonard:「No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face.」
Sheldon:「Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?」
Leonard:「Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.」
Penny:「Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?」


Raj:「Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you'd excuse me, I have to go throw up.」
Mrs. Koothrappali:「What's wrong with him?」
Penny:「I don't know, maybe it's the local cuisine. Okay, well, it's nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I'm going to leave so, Namaste. (Leaves, then almost immediately returns) And FYI, you'd be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.」


Raj:「We can split it two, two and two.」
Howard:「If we’re having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time. ''(There is a knock on the door.)''」
Sheldon:「Oh, what fresh hell is this?」
Leonard:「''(Opening door)'' Hey Penny, come on in.」
Penny:「Hey guys.」
Howard:「See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you'll have good luck.」
Penny:「No you won't. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.」
Leonard:「Sure. What's going on?」
Penny:「Well, there's this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christy. Well, anyway, she called me up and she's like “Hey, how’s California,” and I'm like “Awesome” ‘cause, you know, it's not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.」
Sheldon:「8:08.」
Penny:「Anyway, she got here today, and she's just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she's slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.」
Howard:「Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?」
Penny:「He really needs to dial it down.」
Leonard:「So, if you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?」
Penny:「Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.」
Sheldon:「You know, I apologize for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?」
Leonard:「Oh, I don't think she's a whore.」
Penny:「No, yeah she's definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at... Where's Howard?」


Leonard:「Sounds like a wise man.」
Mary Cooper:「Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some liquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove.」
Penny:「Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.」
Mary Cooper:「Oh, all the time, I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town, well the only problem was he had no, whatchacall, fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it's against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.」
Penny:「What happened?」


'''Scene''':「''Leonard approaches Penny’s door and knocks.''」
Leonard:「Penny, are you okay?」
Penny:「''(Voice off)'' I'm fine, Leonard, just go away.」
Leonard:「Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful....」
Penny:「GO AWAY!」


'''Scene''':「''The Physics Bowl.''」
Penny:「So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on? ''(The guys look confused.)'' Are you ready?」
Leonard:「Oh, yeah. You know you don't have to stay for the whole thing.」
Penny:「Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting.」
Sheldon:「''(Entering in his Star Trek themed shirt)'' Gentlemen.」
Leonard:「Sheldon.」
Howard:「Sheldon.」
Raj:「Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.」
Penny:「Sheldon. I'm just going to sit down.」


Sheldon:「The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.」
Howard:「Too late.」
Sheldon:「Let's say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it's a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it?」
Howard:「Told you not to ask.」
Penny:「Well, Sheldon, you're his friend. Friends give each other presents.」
Sheldon:「I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.」
Howard:「Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention.」
Penny:「What?」
Howard:「Just do it.」
Penny:「It's a non-optional social convention.」
Sheldon:「Oh. Fair enough.」
Howard:「He came with a manual.」
Sheldon:「Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don't drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers.」
Penny:「Okay, let's do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours.」
Howard:「No problem.」
Penny:「And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.」
Howard:「''(After Raj whispers in his ear)'' What if guests show up?」
Penny:「Entertain them.」
Howard:「What if they're women?」
Penny:「Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable.」


Sheldon:「I resent you saying we don't have company.」
Leonard:「I'm sorry.」
Sheldon:「That is an antisocial implication.」
Leonard:「I said I'm sorry.」
Penny:「So, Klingon boggle?」
Leonard:「Yeah, it's like regular boggle, but in Klingon. That's probably enough about us, tell us about you.」
Penny:「Um, me, okay, I'm Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.」
Sheldon:「Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.」
Penny:「Participate in the what?」
Leonard:「I think what Sheldon's trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.」
Penny:「Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign. Okay, let's see, what else, oh, I'm a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak.」
Sheldon:「That's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.」
Leonard:「Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?」
Penny:「Oh, yeah, I'm a waitress at [[the Cheesecake Factory]].」
Leonard:「Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.」
Sheldon:「You're lactose intolerant.」
Leonard:「I don't eat it, I just think it's a good idea.」
Penny:「Oh, anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.」
Leonard:「So it's based on your life?」
Penny:「No, I'm from Omaha.」
Leonard:「Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.」
Penny:「I know, right? Okay, let's see, what else? Um, that's about it. That's the story of Penny.」
Leonard:「Well it sounds wonderful.」
Penny:「It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.」
Sheldon:「''(Mouths) ''What's happening.」
Leonard:「''(Mouths back) ''I don't know.」
Penny:「Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that's like as long as High School.」
Sheldon:「It took you four years to get through High School?」
Leonard:「Don't.」
Penny:「I just, I can't believe I trusted him.」
Leonard:「Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.」
Sheldon:「You? No, you'll only make it worse.」
Penny:「You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?」
Sheldon:「Yes.」
Leonard:「No, it's not crazy it's, uh, uh, it's a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn't make it worse.」
Penny:「Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm such a mess, and on top of everything else I'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work.」
Leonard:「Our shower works.」
Penny:「Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?」


Leonard:「Okay. I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.」
Sheldon:「I'm not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs.」
Leonard:「And we all thank you.」
Sheldon:「Use new eggs. ''(There is a knock on the door).''」
Penny:「''(Popping her head round)'' Hi, hey. I'm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?」
Sheldon:「Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.」
Penny:「I'm sorry?」
Sheldon:「I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.」
Penny:「Four dozen?」
Sheldon:「Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.」
Penny:「Okay, one more time?」
Sheldon:「Never mind, you won't get it right, I'd better come with you.」
Penny:「Oh, yay!」


Sheldon:「There have been studies.」
Toby:「Not double blind studies.」
Sheldon:「How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group.」
Leonard:「As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let's give them some privacy.」
Penny:「Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?」
Leonard:「Sounds good.」
Penny:「I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it?」
Leonard:「Gee, why wouldn't I?」
Penny:「This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.」


Sheldon:「So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.」
Leonard:「I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?」
Sheldon:「No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.」
Leonard:「Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.」
Penny:「Hu... what?」
Sheldon:「He's engaging in ''reductio-ad-absurdum''. It's the logical fallacy of extending someone's argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticizing the result, and I do not appreciate it.」
Leonard:「I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.」
Sheldon:「Okay, well since I'm obviously being ignored here, let's go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20. Plan your oblutions and bodily functions accordingly.」
Penny:「How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?」
Sheldon:「I suggest no liquids after 11pm.」
Leonard:「Here you go.」
Penny:「Thanks Leonard. ''(Arranges pillows on left of couch.)''」
Sheldon:「Hmmph, wrong.」
Penny:「I'm listening.」
Sheldon:「Your head goes on the other end.」
Penny:「Why?」
Sheldon:「It's culturally universal. A bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.」
Penny:「I'll risk it.」
Sheldon:「Hm!」
Penny:「Anything else I should know?」
Sheldon:「Yes. If you use my toothbrush, I'll jump out that window. Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.」
Leonard:「Sorry about that.」
Penny:「That's okay.」
Leonard:「FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light.」
Penny:「Got it.」
Leonard:「Well, sleep tight.」
Penny:「Thanks.」


'''Scene''':「''A corridor at the conference. Penny is attaching Leonard’s name tag.''」
Penny:「There you go.」
Leonard:「You're right, this side does look better.」
Penny:「No, no, I didn't say better, I said less stained.」
Howard:「I just checked the house, there's probably twenty, twenty-five people in there.」
Leonard:「You're kidding.」
Penny:「Is that all?」
Leonard:「All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock.」
Penny:「Oh, well, then good!」
Leonard:「I wasn't expecting such a crowd, I'm a little nervous.」
Howard:「It's okay, just open with a joke, you'll be fine.」
Leonard:「A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there's this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won't lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum. ''(Raj and Howard laugh.)'' Right?」
Penny:「Oh, sorry, I’ve just, I’ve heard it before.」
Howard:「Let's roll. Hey, nice suit.」
Leonard:「It's a classic, right?」
Penny:「I really should have brought my own car.」


Leonard:「Sure.」
Leslie:「Again, it's your decision, you're the man.」
Penny:「''(Voice off, ascending the stairs)'' No, it wasn't my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrödinger.」
Eric:「''(Appearing round corner with Penny)'' From the Charlie Brown cartoons?」
Penny:「No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.」
Leonard:「Hello.」
Penny:「Leslie.」


Lesley:「I didn't know you ate here.」
Sheldon:「We don't. This is a disturbing aberration.」
Leonard:「Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me.」
Howard:「And walks in quiet beauty like the night.」
Penny:「Howard, I’ve asked you not to do that.」
Leonard:「Lesley and I do research together at the University.」
Penny:「Oh, wow, a girl scientist.」


Sheldon:「Who?」
Leonard:「My Physics Bowl Trophy! ''(In weird voice)'' “Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?”」
Sheldon:「Alright that is very immature.」
Leonard:「You're right, I'm sorry. ''(In voice, waving trophy in Sheldon’s face)'' I'm not!」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' Okay, new contest.」
Leonard:「What are you doing?」
Penny:「I'm settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?」
Sheldon:「Absolutely.」
Leonard:「Bring it on.」
Penny:「Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family? ''(They stare at her.)'' The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?」
Sheldon:「''(After they look at each other in confusion)'' The Brady Bunch?」
Penny:「Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum. ''(Pause)'' Oh my God, Sean Penn!」
Leonard:「How do you know these things?」
Penny:「I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine's sexiest man alive?」
Sheldon:「William Shatner.」
Leonard:「Wait, I don't think it's Shatner.」
Sheldon:「Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart.」
Penny:「No.」
Sheldon:「Formal protest.」
Penny:「Alright, singer who sang “Oops I Did It Again.” ''(Sheldon starts involuntarily twitching again.)'' Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?」
Sheldon:「''(After they pass a smug look between each other)'' Romulan.」
Penny:「Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan.」


Howard:「Okay.」
Leonard:「maybe we should take a little break.」
Sheldon:「Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.」
Howard:「''(After Raj whispers in his ear)'' I agree.」
Penny:「What did he say?」
Howard:「He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve.」
Penny:「Yeah, and the bag it came in.」


Leonard:「Six two inch dowels.」
Sheldon:「Check.」
Leonard:「One package, Phillips head screws.」
Sheldon:「Check.」
Penny:「You guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre.」


Sheldon:「The thing is, we’re not....」
Leonard:「We’re really more....」
Sheldon:「No.」
Leonard:「But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.」
Penny:「Are you sure? Come on, it's Halloween.」
Sheldon:「A Halloween party?」
Howard:「As in, costumes?」
Penny:「Well, yeah.」
Leonard:「Is there a theme?」
Penny:「Um, yeah, Halloween.」
Sheldon:「Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific?」
Penny:「As usual, I'm not following.」
Leonard:「He's asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy...」
Penny:「Sure.」
Sheldon:「What about comic-books?」
Penny:「Fine.」
Sheldon:「Anime?」
Penny:「Of course.」
Sheldon:「TV, film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods...」
Penny:「Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye.」


Penny:「How come you didn't go into work today.」
Sheldon:「I'm taking a sabbatical, because I won't kow-tow to mediocre minds.」
Penny:「So you got canned, huh?」
Sheldon:「Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah.」
Penny:「Well, maybe it's all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens.」
Sheldon:「No it doesn't. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved.」
Penny:「No, no, I meant...」
Sheldon:「Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.」
Penny:「Never mind.」
Sheldon:「Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.」
Penny:「We’re fine.」
Sheldon:「Look, you're not leaving yourself enough space between cars.」
Penny:「Oh, sure I am.」
Sheldon:「No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let's say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.」
Penny:「120?」
Sheldon:「Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?」
Penny:「Well, yeah.」
Sheldon:「Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let's say, 4,400lb.」
Penny:「Let's say 4,390.」


'''Scene''':「[[Apartment 4B]]」
Penny:「Okay, here you go, Leonard, one tequila sunrise.」
Leonard:「Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.」
Penny:「Okay, Raj, what'll it be? ''(Raj whispers in Leonard’s ear.)''」
Leonard:「Whatever you recommend.」
Penny:「Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?」
Sheldon:「I'll have a diet coke.」
Penny:「Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.」
Sheldon:「Fine. I'll have a virgin Cuba libre.」
Penny:「That's, um, rum and coke without the rum.」
Sheldon:「Yes,」
Penny:「So coke.」
Sheldon:「Yes. And would you make it diet?」
Penny:「There's a can in the fridge.」
Sheldon:「A Cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.」
Penny:「Then swim to Cuba.」
Sheldon:「Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.」
Penny:「Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who's next?」
Howard:「I'd like to try a slippery nipple.」
Penny:「Okay, you're cut off. Anybody need a refill?」
Raj:「Where did my life go, Penny? One day I'm a carefree bachelor, and the next I'm married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.」
Penny:「A... are you talking to me?」
Raj:「Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course.」
Leonard:「It's amazing.」
Raj:「Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it's time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam.」
Penny:「Okay, sweetie, I think that's the grasshopper talking.」
Raj:「And it's about to tell my parents that I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.」
Penny:「Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don't you just meet this girl and, see what happens.」
Raj:「Haven't you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women.」
Leonard:「Um... Raj.」
Howard:「No, no, let's see how long it takes him.」
Penny:「Um, Raj, honey, you say you can't talk to women but... you've been talking to me.」
Sheldon:「And now we'll never know.」
Raj:「You're right. I... I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?」
Penny:「I'm fine.」
Raj:「Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It's a sweet green miracle.」
Penny:「Okay, if you're going to drink on this date just promise me you won't overdo it.」
Raj:「Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?」
Penny:「Yeah, that. Uh, why don't you bring her to my restaurant when I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?」


Howard:「Perfect, Leonard, why don't you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square meters of scrap aluminum, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.」
Leonard:「Meet back here in an hour?」
Howard:「Done.」
Leonard:「Got it. ''(They all leave).''」
Penny:「Okay, this place does look pretty good.」


'''Scene''':「''All five in Leonard’s car.''」
Leonard:「Is Thai food okay with you Penny?」
Penny:「Sure.」
Sheldon:「We can't have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.」
Penny:「So?」
Sheldon:「They're both curry based cuisines.」
Penny:「So?」
Sheldon:「They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.」
Penny:「Any ideas Raj? ''(He just looks at her with a worried expression.)''」
Howard:「Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.」
Penny:「That sounds like fun.」


Sheldon:「Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.」
Leonard:「Well it's not difficult, you just listen to what she says, and then you say something appropriate in response.」
Sheldon:「To what end?」
Leonard:「Hi. Again.」
Penny:「Hi.」
Sheldon:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Hi.」
Penny:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I'm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don't have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.」
Sheldon:「Leonard, I'm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.」
Penny:「Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?」
Leonard:「Uh, yes.」
Penny:「Oh, that's so nice, I'd love to.」
Leonard:「Great.」
Penny:「So, what do you guys do for fun around here?」


Howard:「Okay. ''(Does something with hands, from which another yellow handkerchief emerges. This one reads “are you sure?” Missy closes the door.)''」
:「''(Time shift. Penny opens the door to Raj.)''」
Penny:「Missy?」
Raj:「Thank you. I apprec.... ''(looks panicked)'' apprec.... appreeee.... oh-oh.」
Penny:「Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?  ''(Raj nods.)''」


'''Scene''':「''The hallway.''」
Leonard:「''(Exiting the apartment)'' You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she's still going to be right.」
Sheldon:「''(Inside)'' I'm not staring, I'm mulling.」
Penny:「Oh, hey Leonard.」
Leonard:「Oh, hi.」
Penny:「So, how's it going?」
Leonard:「Pretty good.」
Penny:「Just pretty good, I'd think you were doing very good.」
Leonard:「Pretty, very, there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?」
Penny:「Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night.」
Leonard:「Sheldon!」
Sheldon:「I'm coming.」
Penny:「So, is it serious, do you like her?」
Leonard:「Wuh, I don't.... th-th-th-that's really two different questions, uh, I'm not.... Sheldon, we have to go!」
Sheldon:「Boy, you're wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.」
Penny:「Alright, well, I'll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard.」


Raj:「I didn't want to make this one.」
Leonard:「Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.」
Raj:「Great, then we'll get married, I won't be able to talk to her, and we'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.」
Howard:「Worked for my parents.」
Penny:「''(Knocking and entering)'' Hi guys.」
Leonard:「Oh, hey.」
Penny:「I need some guinea pigs.」
Sheldon:「Okay, there's a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours.」
Penny:「I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I'm going to get the hang of talking to you.」
Leonard:「His mom's been saying that for years. What's up?」
Penny:「Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks.」
Leonard:「Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.」
Sheldon:「With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example.」
Penny:「So Leonard, how about it?」


'''Scene''':「The entrance lobby. Sheldon is sitting on the bottom step using his laptop. Penny comes down the stairs.」
Penny:「Sheldon? What are you doing?」
Sheldon:「Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.」
Penny:「Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?」
Sheldon:「I'm a modern-day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.」
Penny:「Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don't you just go to a movie or something?」
Sheldon:「Alone?」
Penny:「Yeah, why not?」
Sheldon:「What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich <span style="color:rgb(35,35,142);font-family:'TimesNewRoman';font-size:medium;line-height:normal;">maneuv</span>er.」
Penny:「Well then don't order popcorn.」
Sheldon:「No popcorn at the mo... listen to yourself.」
Penny:「Well why don't you go to a coffee shop.」
Sheldon:「I don't drink coffee.」
Penny:「They have other things.」
Sheldon:「What do they have?」
Penny:「I don't know, you know, cookies, pastries...」
Sheldon:「Pastries such as bearclaws?」
Penny:「Yeah, sure.」
Sheldon:「I don't like bearclaws.」
Leslie:「''(Entering)'' Heya Penny. Dumbass.」
Sheldon:「Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?」
Penny:「Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they're both scientists.」
Sheldon:「Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.」
Penny:「Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.」


Raj:「Ooh, how far into the future?」
Sheldon:「If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10, 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.」
Leonard:「Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10, 2328. Here we go into the future. ''(Pulls lever, the disk begins to spin. The other guys all run around the flat as if moving in fast motion.)'' That was fun.」
Raj:「My turn.」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.」
Leonard:「Are you okay?」
Penny:「Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch.」
Leonard:「That doesn't sound too bad.」
Penny:「It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.」
Leonard:「Sorry.」
Penny:「Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they’d given my shift away. Yeah, that's right, I’ve lost an entire day's pay thanks to this... this...」
Sheldon:「Time machine.」
Leonard:「The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?」
Penny:「No! I don't want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and... and now that... that...」
Sheldon:「Again, time machine.」
Penny:「Oh please, it's not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.」
Sheldon:「It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.」
Penny:「Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic. ''(Storms out. A beat, and then…)''」


Raj:「I can't see him!」
Sheldon:「That's why the call it cloaking, dead man.」
Leonard:「Well then start throwing grenades.」
Raj:「I'm all out!」
Penny:「''(Entering with three other sexy women)'' Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you.」
Leonard:「That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.」
Sheldon:「We said no tanks.」
Raj:「There are no rules in hell!」
Howard:「Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!」
Penny:「Told yah! ''(They leave)''.」


'''Scene''':「''The stairwell.''」
Sheldon:「Thanks for bringing me home.」
Penny:「Oh, it's okay, I didn't really need to work today, it's not like I have rent or car payments or anything.」
Sheldon:「Good. Good.」
Penny:「Okay, well, you feel better.」
Sheldon:「Wait, where are you going?」
Penny:「Um, home, to write some bad checks.」
Sheldon:「You're going to leave me?」
Penny:「Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven't you ever been sick before?」
Sheldon:「Well, of course, but, not by myself.」
Penny:「Really, never?」
Sheldon:「Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.」
Penny:「Studying abroad?」
Sheldon:「No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.」
Penny:「And there was no-one there to take care of you?」
Sheldon:「No. No, my mom had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.」
Penny:「Again?」
Sheldon:「It was tornado season. And it was an aluminum house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said “Möchtest Du eine Darmspülung?”」
Penny:「What does that mean?」
Sheldon:「Based on what happened next, I assume it means “would you like an enema?”」
Penny:「Okay, sweetie, I'll take care of you, what do you need?」
Sheldon:「Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.」
Penny:「Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.」


'''Scene''':「''Penny, Sheldon, Raj and Leonard stand in the apartment doorway. Romantic music plays from Penny’s apartment door.''」
Penny:「Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.」


Howard:「Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card.」
Sheldon:「It's a children's story.」
Howard:「Oh, no it isn't.」
Sheldon:「When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly.」
Penny:「I know the reason.」


Leonard:「Here we go.」
Sheldon:「Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don't actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.」
Leonard:「Ask him for a napkin, I dare you. ''(There is a knock on the door.)'' I'll get it.」
Howard:「Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.」
Penny:「Hey Leonard.」
Leonard:「Oh, hi Penny.」
Penny:「Am I interrupting?」
Leonard:「No.」
Sheldon:「''(Off)'' You're not swelling, Howard.」
Howard:「''(Off)'' No, no, look at my fingers, they're like Vienna sausages!」
Penny:「Sounds like you have company.」
Leonard:「They're not going anywhere. ''(Closes door, staying in hallway.)'' So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work?」
Penny:「Well, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.」
Leonard:「So, you kind of act as like a carbohydrate delivery system.」
Penny:「Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was....」
Leonard:「Yes.」
Penny:「Oh. Okay, great, I'm having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so.... ''(apartment door opens, Sheldon, Raj and Howard appear)'' Oh! Hel...hello!」
Howard:「''(Speaks a phrase "You are a very beautiful girl" in Russian).''」
Penny:「I'm sorry?」
Howard:「Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?」
Penny:「No, I haven't.」
Howard:「Get used to it.」
Penny:「Yeah, I probably won't, but... Hey Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Hi.」
Penny:「Hey Raj! ''(Raj looks uncomfortable)'' Still not talking to me, huh?」
Sheldon:「Don't take it personally, it's his pathology, he can't talk to women.」
Howard:「He can't talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake–scented Goddess!」
Leonard:「So, there's gonna be some furniture delivered?」
Penny:「Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I'm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.」
Leonard:「Yeah, no problem.」
Penny:「Great, here's my spare key. Thank you.」
Leonard:「Penny, wait.」
Penny:「Yeah?」
Leonard:「Um, if you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?」
Penny:「A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?」
Sheldon:「You're kidding, right?」
Penny:「Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?」
Leonard, Sheldon and Howard:「One. ''(Raj raises one finger).''」
Sheldon:「You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.」
Penny:「Yes, I know, men can't fly.」


'''Scene''':「''Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.''」
Leonard:「Okay, well, make yourself at home.」
Penny:「Okay, thank you.」
Leonard:「You're very welcome.」
Penny:「This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?」
Sheldon:「Actually that's my work.」
Penny:「Wow.」
Sheldon:「Yeah, well, it's just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that's just a joke, it's a spoof of the [[Born-Oppenheimer approximation]].」
Penny:「So you're like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.」
Sheldon:「Yeah.」
Penny:「This is really impressive.」
Leonard:「I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.」
Penny:「Holy smokes.」


Sheldon:「Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it's an extremely private matter.」
Leonard:「Still, I'd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn't just conceive.」
Howard:「Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock's dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.」
Raj:「How come on Star Trek everybody's private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose.」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it's just going “aaaaaaa”.」
Leonard:「What did you spill on it?」
Penny:「Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.」
Leonard:「I'll take a look at it.」
Howard:「Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren't fielding a team in the University Physics Bowl this year.」
Leonard:「You're kidding, why not?」
Howard:「They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsberry Farm.」
Penny:「Wow, so in your world, you're like, the cool guys.」
Howard:「Recognize.」
Leonard:「This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod.」
Penny:「Zod?」


Sheldon:「I'll tell you why.」
Leonard and Howard:「O-o-o-oh!」
Sheldon:「I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.」
Penny:「I thought the blowers were more sanitary?」
Leonard and Howard:「Why? Don't!」
Sheldon:「Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.」
Raj:「Hey guys, I just got the most amazing new... (spots Penny) ew-ew-ew」
Penny:「Gosh, Raj, do you think you'll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk? (Shakes head.) Okay, well, I'll just, um, go eat by myself.」
Leonard:「Penny, you don't have to do that.」
Penny:「No, it's okay, between (indicates Raj) him not talking, (indicates Sheldon) him talking and... (indicates Howard) him, I'm better off alone, so, (to Raj) goodbye you poor strange little man (gives him a kiss and exits.)」


'''Scene''':「The stairwell.」
Leonard:「So you see, what you're eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures. It's really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness.」
Penny:「Oh, that's very interesting.」
Leonard:「It's also not pink and has no berries.」
Penny:「Yeah, but it doesn't really answer my question.」
Leonard:「What was your question again?」
Penny:「Do you want some.」
Leonard:「Oh, right, no, I'm lactose intolerant.」
Penny:「Right.」
Leonard:「So, gas.」
Penny:「Got it.」
Leonard:「Well, good night. ''(They kiss. Camera cuts away to a wall mounted security cam above the lift. Leonard spots its movement and shuffles Penny away.)''」
Penny:「What are you doing?」
Leonard:「There was a draft.」
Penny:「I didn't feel a draft.」
Leonard:「Why don't we just go into your....」
Penny:「Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.」
Leonard:「No, no, I didn't mean to go into your apartment to... go fast.」
Penny:「No, I know, I... I know what you meant, it's just... it's only our first date.」
Leonard:「Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don't we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.」
Penny:「Or we could just wing it.」
Leonard:「That might work too.」
Penny:「Goodnight Leonard.」


Leonard:「Sheldon, get out of my way.」
Sheldon:「''(Brandishing toy sword from Leonard’s box)'' None shall pass.」
Leonard:「Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek:  The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.」
Howard:「Okay man, be cool, we’re all friends here.」
Penny:「''(Coming out of her flat)'' What the hell's going on?」
Sheldon:「You hypocrite!」
Penny:「What?」
Sheldon:「Little Miss “grown ups don’t play with toys”. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!」
Penny:「Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.」
Leonard:「No, I needed to hear it.」
Penny:「No you didn't. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are.」
Howard:「I guess that makes me large breasts.」
Leonard:「Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and... you know... move on with my life.」
Penny:「Really?」
Leonard:「Yeah.」
Penny:「Oh. Wow. Good for you. ''(Kisses his cheek.)''」
Leonard:「Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don't know, later...」
Good looking man coming up stairs:「Excuse me. Hey, Penny!」
Penny:「Hi Mike.」
[[Mike (Season 1)|Mike]]:「Are you ready to go.」
Penny:「Yeah, I just have to change.」
Mike:「I'll give you a hand.」
Penny:「Oh, stop it! Bye guys.」


Leonard:「Skynet is kinky? I don't know.」
Sheldon:「Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes.」
Leonard:「Alright, oh wait, they use it to in...」
Sheldon:「''(Buzzing noise)'', too late, I win.」
Penny:「''(Voice off, singing off key)'' Let's go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight.」
Leonard:「What the hell is that?」
Sheldon:「I don't know, but if cats could sing, they’d hate it too. ''(The continue up the stairs and disappear from view)''.」
Penny:「''(Still singing off)'' You wanna prowl, be my night owl, ''(Leonard and Sheldon reappear, running down the stairs)'' we'll take my... ''(appearing)'' Hey guys, hi! Where you going?」
Leonard:「What? Oh we just had to... mail some letters and ''(seeing Sheldon has large bag in hand and bin is nearby)'' throw away some chicken. ''(Sheldon very reluctantly does.)''」
Penny:「You'll never guess what just happened.」
Leonard:「Oh, I give up.」
Sheldon:「I don't guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I'm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot.」
Penny:「What was that?」
Leonard:「Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?」
Penny:「Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why?」
Sheldon:「I have a conclusion based on an observation.」
Leonard:「No you don't. No he doesn't.」
Penny:「Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her.」
Leonard:「Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.」
Penny:「It's not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know.」
Sheldon:「I think I know.」
Leonard:「No you don't. He doesn't.」
Penny:「It's this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?」
Together:「No.」
Leonard:「Because.... uh, Friday, we are attending a [http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Seminar_on_Molecular_Positronium Symposium on Molecular Positronium]」
Sheldon:「I think that's a week from Tuesday at six.」
Leonard:「No, it's this Friday, at eight.」
Penny:「Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys.」


'''Scene''':「''The hallway. Leonard is outside Penny’s door.''」
Penny:「''(Opening door)'' Hi.」
Leonard:「Yeah, hi, listen, I know what's been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.」
Penny:「What are you talking about.」
Leonard:「First I want to say that it's not Sheldon's fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn't drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.」
Penny:「He told you?」
Leonard:「Yes, but it's okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there's a simple solution. ''(Hands her a brochure.)''」
Penny:「Pasadena city college?」
Leonard:「A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here's playing hacky sack, and this girl's going to be a paralegal.」
Penny:「Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can't date a girl without a fancy college degree.」
Leonard:「Well, it's really not that fancy, it's just a city college.」
Penny:「Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?」
Leonard:「That doesn't matter to me at all.」
Penny:「So, it's fine with you if I'm not smart.」


'''Scene''':「''[[The Cheesecake Factory]]''」
Penny:「Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that's served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day...」
Sheldon:「''(Appearing behind her)'' You must release me from my oath.」
Penny:「Sheldon, I'm working.」
Sheldon:「Why don't you take a minute to decide ''(leads her away)'' I can't keep your secret Penny. I'm going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.」
Penny:「Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?」
Sheldon:「I'm constitutionally incapable. That's why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.」
Penny:「Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?」
Sheldon:「Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven't forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.」
Penny:「Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you're just going to have to figure out a way to do it.」


'''Scene''':「''Howard and Raj sneak up the stairwell carrying presents. Howard knocks on Penny’s door, a combination of two knocks, two knocks, one knock. Nothing happens. He tries again. Sheldon opens the door.''」
Sheldon:「That's not the secret knock. This is the secret knock. ''(He knocks two, one, two.)''」
Howard:「What difference does it make?」
Sheldon:「The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one's co-conspirators.」
Penny:「Is that Raj and Howard?」
Sheldon:「Possibly, but unverified.」
Howard:「Can you just let us in.」
Sheldon:「Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor.」
Penny:「So, what did you get the birthday boy?」
Howard:「Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics.」
Penny:「Nice. I got him a sweater.」
Howard:「Okay, well, he might like that, I’ve seen him... chilly.」
Penny:「Uh, Sheldon, I didn't see your present.」
Sheldon:「That's because I didn't bring one.」
Penny:「Well why not?」


'''Scene''':「''Leonard approaches Penny’s door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.''」
Penny:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Hi.」
Penny:「Come on in.」
Leonard:「Thank you. You look very nice.」
Penny:「Thank you. So do you.」
Leonard:「I made an eight o’clock reservation.」
Penny:「Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first.」
Leonard:「Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrödinger's Cat?」
Penny:「Actually, I’ve heard far too much about Schrödinger's Cat.」
Leonard:「Good. ''(He grabs her and kisses her.)''」
Penny:「Alright, the cat's alive. Let's go to dinner.」


Christy:「Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.」
Howard:「When they perfect human cloning, I'm going to order twelve of those.」
Leonard:「Howard, can't you see she's using you?」
Howard:「Who cares? Last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!」
Penny:「Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.」
Howard:「Really?」
Penny:「Yeah.」


Leonard:「Penny's still sleeping.」
Sheldon:「Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal...」
Leonard:「I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed?」
Sheldon:「Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.」
Penny:「Uh, what time is it?」
Leonard:「Almost 6:30.」
Penny:「I slept all day?」
Leonard:「Oh, no, it's 6:30 in the morning.」
Penny:「What the hell is your problem?」
Sheldon:「Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.」
Howard:「''(Entering)'' Hola, nerd-migos.」
Penny:「Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?」
Howard:「Oh, yeah, sorry, I'll have it cleaned.」
Penny:「That's okay, keep it. Where's Christy.」
Howard:「In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt? Yours reaches places that mine just won't.」
Penny:「Y-you used my loofah?」
Howard:「More precisely ''we'' used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!」
Penny:「You can keep that too.」


'''Scene''':「''Inside Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.''」
Howard:「This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.」
Penny:「Wow, cool tiger.」
Howard:「Yeah, I’ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.」
Penny:「Uh, sounds interesting.」
Howard:「So you'll think about it?」
Penny:「Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.」
Raj:「Smooth.」
Leonard:「We’re home.」
Penny:「Oh, my God, what happened?」
Leonard:「Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.」
Penny:「I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.」
Leonard:「No, it was a valid hypothesis.」
Sheldon:「That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?」
Penny:「Really, thank you so much for going and trying you're, uh, you're so terrific. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?」


'''Scene''':「''The store. Sheldon is looking at two routers.''」
Sheldon:「What do you think.」
Penny:「''(Pointing randomly)'' Um, that one.」
Sheldon:「Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.」
Penny:「Sure.」
Sheldon:「He doesn't need them, he's already got a 640 connect switch」
Penny:「Oh, okay then this one.」
Sheldon:「Why?」
Penny:「I don't know, the man on the box looks so happy.」
Sheldon:「Penny! If I'm going to buy Leonard a gift, I'm going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.」
Penny:「Oh, I know I'm going to regret this but, what trauma?」
Sheldon:「On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.」
Penny:「Of course.」
Sheldon:「Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me... wow, this is hard. They got me... a motorised dirt bike.」
Penny:「No?」
Sheldon:「What twelve-year-old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?」
Penny:「All of them.」
Sheldon:「Really?」
Penny:「Yeah.」
Sheldon:「Huh?」
Penny:「Okay, so we’re getting this one?」
Sheldon:「Yeah, I suppose.」
Penny:「Okay, let's go.」


Sheldon:「I know everything about this stuff.」
Woman:「Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse.」
Penny:「Here, buy this one. Look, it's the one we’re getting, see, happy guy available.」


'''Scene''':「''The store. Sheldon is on the in-store computer.''」
Sheldon:「Okay, we don't have that in stock, but I can special order it for you.」
Penny:「''(With shop assistant, points at Sheldon)'' Him.」
Assistant:「Excuse me, sir, you don't work here.」
Sheldon:「Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else.」
Penny:「Sheldon, we have to go.」
Sheldon:「Why?」
Penny:「Well, for one thing, we’re late for Leonard's birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security.」
Sheldon:「''(To customer)'' Good luck. ''(To assistant)'' By the way, a six-year-old could hack your computer system.」
Penny:「Keep walking.」


'''Scene''':「The hallway. Howard knocks on Penny's door with his bow.」
Howard:「Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver.」
Penny:「''(Opening door, not in costume)'' Oh, hey guys.」
Leonard:「Hey, sorry we’re late.」
Penny:「Late? It's 7」
Sheldon:「And you said the party starts at seven.」
Penny:「Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.」
Sheldon:「It's 7」
Penny:「Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.」
Howard:「What, are all the girls in the bathroom?」
Penny:「Probably, but in their own homes.」
Sheldon:「So what time does the costume parade start?」
Penny:「The parade?」
Sheldon:「Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.」
Penny:「Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes.」
Sheldon:「This party is just going to suck.」
Penny:「No, come on, it's going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that's so cute.」
Leonard:「Actually, Penny, he's Rob...」
Howard:「I'm Peter Pan! And I’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.」
Penny:「No you don't. Oh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be.」
Leonard:「Oh, he's the Doppler Effect.」
Sheldon:「Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.」
Penny:「Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.」


Sheldon:「Alright, I'm moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.」
Howard:「Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.」
Leonard:「No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.」
Raj:「Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.」
Penny:「Hi, you guys ready to order?」
Howard:「Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?」
Leonard:「And Orcs!」
Penny:「I'll be back.」
Raj:「Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.」
Penny:「Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back.」
Howard:「What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?」
Penny:「A shower.」
Howard:「I'll take the heart smart platter.」
Penny:「Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「We don't eat here, I don't know what's good.」
Penny:「Well, it's all good.」
Sheldon:「Statistically unlikely.」
Leonard:「Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.」
Sheldon:「I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here.」
Leonard:「I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.」
Penny:「Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?」
Sheldon:「Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.」
Penny:「The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.」
Sheldon:「Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?」
Penny:「Because you are not at Big Boy!」


'''Scene''':「''The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.''」
Leonard:「Come on, guys, push.」
Howard:「''(Off)'' If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon.」
Penny:「''(Coming out of her apartment)'' Oh, hey guys.」
Leonard:「''(Letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)'' Uh, hi Penny. ''(Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.)'' Take a break, guys!」
Penny:「What are you doing?」
Leonard:「Oh, just, you know, moving a... time machine.」
Penny:「Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so....」
Leonard:「No problem. ''(Removes glasses, pulls down out of order tape from lift doors, and forces them open.)'' Hang on. ''(Takes Penny in his arms as he holds onto the lift cable.)''」
Penny:「But, what about your time machine.」
Leonard:「Some things are more important than toys. ''(She puts her arms around his neck as he dangles from the cable.)''」
Penny:「Oh, I'm scared.」
Leonard:「Don't worry baby, I’ve got you.」
Penny:「Oh, Leonard. ''(Kisses him as they descend from view. Leonard wakes up still sitting in the time machine.)''」


'''Scene''':「Penny's flat. Penny is on her laptop. Everything around her is littered with empty food packaging and red bull cans. She burps loudly. Sheldon is sitting on the sofa.」
Penny:「Okay, I'm at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I'm going in.」
Sheldon:「Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.」
Penny:「Got it.」
Sheldon:「I must say, you're playing very well for a woman of 23?」
Penny:「22.」
Sheldon:「Right. 22. ''(Cut to his screen, he is filling in an online dating profile.)''」
Penny:「Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?」
Sheldon:「What happened to the rest of your group?」
Penny:「I dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies.」
Sheldon:「Frenzy stance.」
Penny:「Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!」
Sheldon:「So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?」
Penny:「What?」
Sheldon:「These are market research questions. I'm filling out the online registration for your game.」
Penny:「Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn't working, die you undead mummy, die!」
Sheldon:「Drink a healing potion.」
Penny:「Thank you.」
Sheldon:「You're welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?」
Penny:「That's on the registration?」
Sheldon:「Oh yes, it's quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests.」
Penny:「Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I'm a big old five.」


'''Scene''':「''On the stairwell of the apartment building.''」
Sheldon:「That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.」
Penny:「Oh, I don't know Sheldon, it's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.」
Sheldon:「Are you sure? There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month's supply at a time.」
Penny:「What?」
Sheldon:「Well think about it, it's a product that doesn't spoil, and you're going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.」
Penny:「You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?」
Sheldon:「Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?」
Penny:「Okay, I'm not talking about this with you.」


Howard:「Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it.」
Sheldon:「Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling; previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying.」
Leonard:「Just... eat your tangerine chicken.」
Sheldon:「I'd love to, but I don't have tangerine chicken.」
Penny:「''(Storming in)'' Thank you so much for your stupid advice. ''(Slams door again.)''」


Sheldon:「So it was working.」
Leonard:「It wasn't, it was not, you are a nutcase.」
Sheldon:「Oh we'll see about that ''(tries again)'', heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone.」
Leonard:「Stop, stop it, quit it. ''(They start to fight.)''」
Penny:「Is this usually how these physics things go?」


Raj:「Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?」
Missy:「I guess.」
Raj:「We Indians invented them. You're welcome.」
Howard:「Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You're welcome!」
Penny:「Missy, I'm going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?」
Missy:「God yes. Thanks.」
Penny:「You're welcome.」
Missy:「Bye guys.」
Howard:「Bye Missy.」
Leonard:「Bye Missy, see you.」
Penny:「Goodbye Leonard!」


Dr. Koothrappali:「So, she's not Indian, the boy's just sowing some wild oats.」
Penny:「No, no, there's no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.」


Sheldon:「You're in trouble.」
Kurt:「You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.」
Penny:「Okay, Kurt, please.」


Sheldon:「But I answered, it's called teamwork.」
Howard:「Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.」
Sheldon:「By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.」
Leonard:「Just ask another one.」
Penny:「Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? ''(Raj buzzes.)''」
Sheldon:「And of course it's Gravity Probe B.」
Leonard:「Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.」
Sheldon:「Why?」
Penny:「Because it's polite.」
Sheldon:「What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?」
Penny:「Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.」


'''Scene''':「''The supermarket.''」
Sheldon:「This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives.」
Penny:「Thank you.」
Sheldon:「No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.」
Penny:「Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn't you say you needed some eggs.」
Sheldon:「Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.」
Penny:「Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then.」
Sheldon:「No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you'll really enjoy this, is, they're shelved with the vegetables, but they're technically a fruit.」
Penny:「Interesting.」
Sheldon:「Isn't it?」
Penny:「No, I mean what you find enjoyable.」
Sheldon:「''(As Penny selects vitamin supplements)'' Oh boy.」
Penny:「What now?」
Sheldon:「Well, there's some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.」
Penny:「Well, maybe that's what I was going for.」


Leonard:「Yes! For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.」
Sheldon:「You have a sarcasm sign?」
Leonard:「No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.」
Sheldon:「Do you want some cereal. I'm feeling so good today I'm going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.」
Penny:「align="left" |''(Voice off)'' Son of a Bitch!」
Leonard:「Penny's up.」
Penny:「''(Voice off)'' You sick, geeky bastards!」
Leonard:「How did she know it was us?」
Sheldon:「I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her bedroom closet.」
Penny:「align="left" |''(Voice off)'' Leonard!」
Leonard:「God, this is going to be bad.」
Sheldon:「Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?」
Leonard:「Yes, but, only to clean.」
Sheldon:「Really more to organize, you're not actually dirty, per se.」
Penny:「Give me back my key.」
Leonard:「I'm very, very sorry.」
Penny:「Do you understand how creepy this is.」
Leonard:「Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.」
Penny:「In my apartment, while I was sleeping.」
Sheldon:「And snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It's a throat doctor.」
Penny:「And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?」
Sheldon:「Depending on the depth, that's either a proctologist or a general surgeon. ''(Leonard holds up a sign reading “Sarcasm”)'' Oh!」
Penny:「God!」
Leonard:「Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you're feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you're feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.」
Penny:「Stay away from me.」


Penny:「Hey Sheldon!」
Sheldon:「''(Unlocking his mailbox)'' Hello Penny.」
Penny:「Get anything good?」
Sheldon:「Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.」
Penny:「Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn't. ''(Sheldon looks confused)''. It was a joke. ''(Sheldon gives a fake laugh.)'' Yup, tip your waitresses, I'm here all week.」
Sheldon:「Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.」
Penny:「Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it. ''(The begin to climb)'' Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard...」
Sheldon:「Oh dear God!」
Penny:「Little misunderstanding, huh.」
Sheldon:「A little misunder.... Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.」
Penny:「Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.」
Sheldon:「Huh.」
Penny:「Well how do you feel?」
Sheldon:「I don't understand the question.」
Penny:「Well I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.」
Sheldon:「Oh. I hadn't thought about it like that. I wonder if I’ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.」
Penny:「Wait... what?」
Sheldon:「I couldn't poop this morning.」
Penny:「You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can work this out.」
Sheldon:「It's certainly preferable to my plan.」
Penny:「Which was?」
Sheldon:「A powerful laxative.」
Penny:「Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there's no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.」
Sheldon:「Excuse me, little idea?」
Penny:「Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn't really understand it but...」
Sheldon:「Of course you didn't, he said little idea?」
Penny:「Uh, well no, no, not in... not in those words.」
Sheldon:「In what words then, exactly」
Penny:「Um, gee, the exact words aren't written... it's more the spirit in which it's」
Sheldon:「What did he say?」
Penny:「You had a lucky hunch.」
Leonard:「''(Coming out of apartment)'' Hey, Sheldon, I’ve been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don't....」
Sheldon:「Don't you ever speak to me again.」
Leonard:「What... ''(Sheldon goes into apartment and slams the door)''.」
Penny:「Uh, he... ''(makes “he’s screwy” hand movements, turns to go)''.」


Sheldon:「No?」
Leonard:「No.」
Sheldon:「No.」
Leonard:「Well, we'll get out of your hair.」
Penny:「Okay, great, thank you again ''(she throws her jacket over the back of the sofa).''」
Sheldon:「Penny, I just want you to know that, you don't have to live like this. I'm here for you.」
Penny:「What's he talking about?」
Leonard:「It's a joke.」
Penny:「I don't get it.」


'''Scene''':「''The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.''」
Sheldon:「Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your...」
Penny:「''(Tapping him on the shoulder)'' Sheldon.」
:「''(Jumping in panic)'' Aieee ya! Xia si wo le.」
Penny:「I'm sorry. Look, do you have a second.」
Sheldon:「A second what? Pair of underwear?」
Penny:「I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It's about Leonard.」
Sheldon:「Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?」
Penny:「Well, Raj can't talk to me unless he's drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting.」
Sheldon:「Yes, I suppose he is.」
Penny:「All I'm saying is, you know Leonard the best.」
Sheldon:「Not necessarily. I'm often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don't condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.  ''(Time shift)'' And until recently I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance, he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that I maintain in the right concentration could be weaponized. ''(Begins to unlock apartment door.)''」
Penny:「Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment.」
Sheldon:「We’re not done?」
Penny:「No.」
Sheldon:「Ach, why not? We’re already through the looking glass anyway.」
Penny:「Okay, so, here's the thing. I guess you're aware that Leonard asked me out.」
Sheldon:「Well, he didn't actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia.」
Penny:「Oh, that's nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just... want to sit down?」
Sheldon:「Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don't spend much time here and so I’ve never really chosen a place to sit.」
Penny:「Well, choose.」
Sheldon:「There are a number of options and, I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.」
Penny:「Alright, why don't you just pick one at random, and then if you don't like it you can sit somewhere else next time.」
Sheldon:「No, no, that's crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out.」
Penny:「Okay. Um, here's the thing. So, I’ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me...」
Sheldon:「A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy.」
Penny:「Alright, yeah, I don't really know who they are...」
Sheldon:「Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon...」
Penny:「Yeah, I don't care, I don't care. The point is Leonard isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with.」
Sheldon:「Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees?」
Penny:「No. What I'm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well.」
Sheldon:「The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare!」
Penny:「But on the other hand, if things don't go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he's not looking for a fling, he's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don't know, like you would say light years.」
Sheldon:「I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time.」
Penny:「Thank you for the clarification.」
Sheldon:「Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that's a unit of work, not of weight.」
Penny:「Right, thanks.」
Sheldon:「It's a common mistake.」
Penny:「Not the first one I’ve made today.」
Sheldon:「Okay. I think this will be my seat.」
Penny:「Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I'm talking about.」
Sheldon:「Well, let's see. We might consider Schrödinger's Cat.」
Penny:「Schrödinger? Is that the woman in 2A?」
Sheldon:「No. That's Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip...」
Penny:「Sheldon!」
Sheldon:「Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrödinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.」
Penny:「I'm sorry, I don't get the point.」
Sheldon:「Well of course you don't get it, I haven't made it yet. You'd have to be psychic to get it, and there's no such thing as psychic.」
Penny:「Sheldon, what's the point?」
Sheldon:「Just like Schrödinger's Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is.」
Penny:「Okay, so you're saying I should go out with Leonard.」


Howard:「Come on, come on, get up.」
Leonard:「Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.」
Sheldon:「I weep for humanity.」
Leonard:「Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. ''(Leaves and knocks on Penny’s door.)''」
Penny:「''(Answering)'' Ah, hey Leonard.」
Leonard:「Hi Penny, how's it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?」
Penny:「Uh, pretty much, why?」
Leonard:「Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?」
Penny:「Of course.」


Sheldon:「Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.」
Leonard:「There's not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.」
Kurt:「''(Physically lifting Leonard from the ground)'' C – O – N... frontation!」
Penny:「Kurt, put him down this instant.」
Kurt:「He started it.」
Penny:「I don't care, I'm finishing it, put him down.」
Kurt:「Fine. You're one lucky little leprechaun.」
Sheldon:「He's a Hobbit! I’ve got your back.」
Penny:「Leonard, are you okay.」
Leonard:「Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us, it's just getting a little late so....」
Penny:「Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.」


'''Scene''':「''[[Apartment 4B]]. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub.''」
Leonard:「''(Knocking and entering)'' Hey, listen, I know you said that you didn't want to talk...」
Penny:「I don't.」
Leonard:「''(Leaving)'' Sorry.」
Penny:「Wait.」
Leonard:「Wait, did you say wait?」
Penny:「Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers?」
Leonard:「No. No.」
Penny:「Okay, so I pick good guys, but turn them into losers.」
Leonard:「Of course not.」
Penny:「Well, it's got to be one or the other, which is it?」
Leonard:「I'm sorry, what were the choices again?」
Penny:「I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart.」
Leonard:「Yeah, no, sure.」
Penny:「You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.」
Leonard:「Actually it's not all that easy to find.」
Penny:「Yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it.」
Leonard:「Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought.... never mind.」
Penny:「Nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. Oh God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die.」
Leonard:「Okay, well, you know, this isn't that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who's open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales.」
Penny:「Oh God!」
Leonard:「Elevators, parks, movie theaters, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop?」
Penny:「Sandwich shop.」
Leonard:「Doesn't that violate the health code?」
Penny:「No, at the sub shop we were only making out.」
Leonard:「Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed.」
Penny:「Really, do you think I overreacted?」
Leonard:「Maybe a little.」
Penny:「‘Cause I do that, I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologize.」
Leonard:「No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks, and fast food franchise.」
Penny:「Yes. You're right. I should just say I'm done with him.」
Leonard:「Yes, you should, go ahead, say it.」
Penny:「But I never gave the man a chance to explain.」
Leonard:「What is there to explain, it's all right here, it's a betrayal.」
Penny:「No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels.」
Leonard:「I'm pretty sure I never said that.」
Penny:「No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own.」
Leonard:「Aw, good for me. Where are you going?」
Penny:「I'm going over to Mike's. Leonard, thank you so much.」


Leonard:「Okay, fine, we'll just play one on one until he gets back.」
Sheldon:「One on one? We don't play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!」
Leonard:「Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.」
Raj:「Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there's a billion more where he came from.」
Penny:「Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.」
Leonard:「Great idea.」
Sheldon:「Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.」
Penny:「Why?」
Sheldon:「Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.」
Penny:「Oh, what, what, what?」
Sheldon:「This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.」
Penny:「''(Picking up a controller, there is the sound of an explosion from the television)'' Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?」
Sheldon:「Mine.」
Penny:「Okay, I got this. Lock and load, boys.」
Leonard:「It's the only way we can play teams.」
Sheldon:「Yes, but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh.... ''(another explosion)''」
Penny:「Ha-ha! There goes your head again.」
Sheldon:「Okay, this isn't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just respawned, you need to give them a chance to-- ''(explosion)'' Now, come on!」
Sheldon:「Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered, cover me.」
Penny:「Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!」
Leonard:「Penny, you are on fire.」
Penny:「Yeah, so is Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Okay, that's it, I don't know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.」
Penny:「Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.」
Sheldon:「What?」
Penny:「This plasma grenade. ''(Explosion.)'' Ha! Look, it's raining you!」
Sheldon:「You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.」
Penny:「Gosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?」
Leonard:「Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner.」
Penny:「Well, it's been fun.」
Leonard:「You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.」
Penny:「Or we could just have a life.」
Leonard:「I guess for you that's an option.」
Penny:「Good night, Leonard.」
Leonard:「Good night.」
Penny:「As usual, nice talking to you Raj ''(leaves.)''」


Leonard:「She's an enigma, Raj.」
Sheldon:「And another thing, there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab...」
Leonard:「She's gone, Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Well she could have said goodbye.」
Penny:「''(Entering again)'' Okay, I have a problem.」
Sheldon:「It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.」
Leonard:「What's wrong?」
Penny:「Um, well, Howard and Christy are... kind of... hooking up in my bedroom.」
Leonard:「Are you sure?」
Penny:「Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?」
Leonard:「No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics.」
Penny:「Uh, the couch is good.」


'''Scene''':「''Back at the apartment.''」
Penny:「''(To Raj) ''So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?」
:「''(Raj looks at her, looks back at his food, takes a mouthful).''」
Penny:「Uh, I'm sorry, do you speak English?」
Howard:「Oh, he speaks English, he just can't speak to women.」
Penny:「Really, why?」


Leonard:「O-o-o-o-h! Again?」
Sheldon:「Obviously you're not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed.」
Leonard:「Just reset the board.」
Sheldon:「It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels. ''(Gestures at the many levels of the board.)''」
Penny:「''(Knocking and entering)'' Hi guys.」
Leonard:「Hey!」
Penny:「Did you get my mail.」
Leonard:「Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?」
Penny:「Oh, better than North Dakota! ''(Pause)'' I guess that joke's only funny in Nebraska.」
Sheldon:「From the data at hand you really can't draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.」
Penny:「Boy, it's good to be back.」
Leonard:「How was your family?」
Penny:「Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.」
Sheldon:「Sick?」
Leonard:「''(Knowing what's going to happen)'' Here we go.」
Sheldon:「''(Running to opposite side of the room)'' What kind of sick?」
Penny:「Oh, the flu I guess.」
Sheldon:「I don't need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?」
Penny:「Maybe Friday.」
Sheldon:「Friday, was that morning or afternoon?」
Penny:「I... I don't...」
Sheldon:「Think woman, who blew their nose and when?」
Leonard:「Sheldon, relax, she doesn't have any symptoms, I'm sure she's not contagious.」
Sheldon:「Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.」
Leonard:「Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon, he's a bit of a germophobe.」
Penny:「Oh, it's okay, I understand.」
Sheldon:「Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.」
Leonard:「You'd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol.」
Penny:「Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.」


'''Scene''':「Sheldon's bedroom. There is a knock on the door. Penny enters.」
Penny:「''(Whispering)'' Sheldon. ''(Sing-song)'' Shel-don.」
Sheldon:「Danger, danger.」
Penny:「No danger, look, it's just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?」
Sheldon:「You're in my bedroom.」
Penny:「Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.」
Sheldon:「People can't be in my bedroom.」
Penny:「Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?」
Sheldon:「I'm not wearing pajama bottoms.」
Penny:「Why not?」
Sheldon:「I spilled grape juice.」
Penny:「Well, wear different pajamas.」
Sheldon:「I can't wear different pajamas, these are my Monday pajamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.」
Penny:「Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?」
Sheldon:「You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?」
Penny:「Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I'm just not sure it's the right move for my character.」
Sheldon:「Of course it's not, you're only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder.」
Penny:「Really? Boy, you'd think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.」
:「Cut to Leonard, exiting his bedroom.」
Sheldon:「''(Off)'' Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep.」
Penny:「''(Off)'' Okay, well you were great, thanks. ''(Comes out door)'' Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don't got in Sheldon's room, he's not wearing bottoms.」


''Scene'':「Raj's apartment. Raj is heard singing in a drunk voice through the door. He enters with his arm around Penny.」
Raj:「Welcome to the Raj Mahal.」
Penny:「Yes, it's very nice, goodnight Raj.」
Raj:「No, wait, the evening's not over.」
Penny:「Yes it is.」
Raj:「No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.」
Penny:「Oh, wow, is the evening over.」
Raj:「Wait, wait, that's my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents.」
Penny:「Wait, meet them.」
Raj:「Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I'm not drunk.」
[[Mrs. Koothrappali]]:「Why would you say that?」
Raj:「Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny.」
Penny:「I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.」


Sheldon:「My apologies Leonard, I'm only as good as my teacher.」
Leonard:「Why are you learning Chinese?」
Sheldon:「I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.」
Leonard:「If I were you, I'd be more concerned by what they're passing off as chicken.」
Penny:「''(Storming in)'' I need to use your window.」
Leonard:「Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead.」
Penny:「''(Opening window)'' Hey Jerkface, you forgot your iPod! ''(Throws it out the window.)''」
Leonard:「What's going on?」
Penny:「Oh, I'll tell you what's going on, that stupid self-centered bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog. ''(Out of window)'' Drop dead, you stupid self-centered bastard! ''(To Leonard)'' Thank you. ''(exit)''」


'''Scene''':「''The cinema. Everyone is wearing ape masks.''」
Howard:「Look at this, everyone went chimp.」
Raj:「Well I'd like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. ''(Phone rings)''.」
Leonard:「Oh, hi Penny!」
Penny:「Hey, where are you?」
Leonard:「I'm... uh... at work.」
Penny:「You sound funny.」
Leonard:「I'm... uh... in a... I'm in a radiation suit. What's up?」
Penny:「Yeah, well I'm at work too, and you'll never guess who's here infecting my entire station.」
Leonard:「''(To Howard and Raj)'' Sheldon's at the Cheesecake Factory. ''(Into phone)'' Just tell him to go home.」
Penny:「He won't leave, he says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.」
Leonard:「''(To Howard and Raj)'' He's paranoid, and he's established a nest.」
Penny:「Can you please come get him?」


Howard:「No thanks, peanuts, I can't afford to swell up in these tights.」
Sheldon:「I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?」
Leonard:「We’re socialising. Meeting new people.」
Sheldon:「Telepathically?」
Penny:「''(Crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen)'' Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!」


Howard:「What? Why?」
Sheldon:「You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?」
Leonard:「Come on, you need a four-person team, we’re four people.」
Sheldon:「By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.」
Penny:「I want tickets to that please.」


Raj:「Speaking of untouchables, I’ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.」
Howard:「Oh, gee, thanks.」
Raj:「Oh, you're welcome. Of course, I couldn't get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that's for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.」
Sheldon:「There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. (Smiles)」
Penny:「Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.」


Leonard:「This is bad.」
Sheldon:「Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he's going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex.」
Leonard:「Really, really bad.」
Sheldon:「I'm surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she's a big old five.」
Penny:「''(Entering, looking ratty in baggy clothes and with her hair unwashed)'' Sheldon, what do you want.」
Sheldon:「Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I'd like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny.」
[[Tom]]:「Hi Penny.」
Penny:「Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I'm here, I'm on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don't know what they're doing, we’ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.」
Sheldon:「Can we talk about this later.」
Penny:「No, no, no, no, I need you now.」
Sheldon:「But wouldn't you prefer to socialize with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman.」
Penny:「Whatever, I'll figure it out myself.」


Waitress:「Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen.」
Penny:「No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?」
Sheldon:「I'm sick, thank you very much.」
Penny:「How could you have gotten it from me, I'm not sick.」
Sheldon:「You're a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You're doomed!」
Penny:「Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.」
Sheldon:「I want soup.」
Penny:「''(Over Sheldon’s strange throat clearance)'' Why didn't you just.... ''(louder throat clearance)'' Why didn't you just have soup at home.」
Sheldon:「Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don't you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?」
Penny:「You can have soup delivered.」
Sheldon:「I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.」
Penny:「Okay, what kind of soup do you want.」
Sheldon:「Well, my mother used to make me this [http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Homemade_Soup split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home-made croutons].」
Penny:「We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.」
Sheldon:「Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?」
Penny:「No.」


Sheldon:「Oh-ho! Really? Well here's another "nit" for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.」
Howard:「Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy. They're about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.」
Sheldon:「Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”」
Howard:「I don't care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.」
Penny:「''(Arriving with Eric)'' Hi guys. Looks like you've been to the Renaissance fair. I'm hoping.」
Sheldon:「Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.」
Penny:「Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.」
Howard:「Hello.」
Leonard:「Hi.」
[[Eric]]:「Hey.」
Leonard:「So, yeah, good to see you.」
Penny:「Yeah, yeah, it's good to see you too. We should really go.」
Eric:「Yeah.」
Penny:「''(Leaving)'' Bye guys.」


Leonard:「Okay, it's on.」
Howard:「Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.」
Leonard:「I know.」
Howard:「Hang on, the sensor's picking up something, turn your head back. ''(Camera angle shows a pair of female legs.)''」
Penny:「You rat bastard.」
Howard:「''(Running down stairs with Raj)'' Told you the sensor would work.」
Leonard:「Hi!」
Penny:「You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.」
Leonard:「Well, I had to, you see what he's like.」
Sheldon:「''(Off)'' Penny! Penny, I'm hungry.」
Penny:「Uh, it's okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard's home!」
Leonard:「No!」
Penny:「''(Handing him vaporub)'' Here you go, good luck, bye.」


Sheldon:「No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back.」
Howard:「I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster.」
Sheldon:「I was giving clear, concise orders.」
Leonard:「You hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.”」
Penny:「''(Arriving)'' Oh, hey guys.」
Leonard:「Hello Penny.」
Howard:「Morning ma’am.」
Penny:「So, how was paintball, did you have fun?」
Sheldon:「Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. ''(To Howard)'' You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.」
Penny:「Okay, um, oh hey, I'm having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.」
Leonard:「A party?」
Penny:「Yeah.」
Howard:「A boy-girl party?」
Penny:「Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it'll just be a bunch of my friends, we'll have some beer, do a little dancing...」


Leonard:「Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.」
Sheldon:「Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman's flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from exposure to Earth's yellow Sun.」
Howard:「Yeah, and you don't have a problem with that, how does he fly at night?」
Sheldon:「Uh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.」
Penny:「I'm just going to go wash up.」


'''Scene''':「''The living room of the apartment.''」
Penny:「''(To Raj)'' Mmm, this is really delicious, isn't it? ''(Raj looks uncomfortable, then nods.)'' Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh? ''(Shakes head)'' Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.」
Howard:「Hey, I'm damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?」
Penny:「Sure. Raj, hug Howard.」


Howard:「''(Voice from inside)'' Make sure they remember no peanuts.」
Leonard:「Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts. They see me coming they go “ah, no peanut boy!”」
:「''(Leonard exits down stairs. A moment later, Penny peeks out of her apartment, checks the coast is clear, and crosses the hall to the guys apartment. Knocks.)''」
Sheldon:「''(Answering)'' Hello Penny. Leonard just left.」
Penny:「I know. I want to talk to you.」
Sheldon:「What would we talk about? We’ve no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of, and you know I don't care for chit-chat.」
Penny:「Okay, can you just let me in.」
Sheldon:「Well alright, but I don't see this as a promising endeavour.」
Penny:「Okay, here's the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.」
Sheldon:「I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.」
Howard:「Did someone say party?」
Penny:「He just doesn't know he wants one because he's never had one.」
Howard:「I suppose that's possible, but for the record, I’ve never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.」
Penny:「Howard, here's the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.」
Howard:「Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it. I'm just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend?」
Sheldon:「I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.」
Penny:「Anguish?」
Sheldon:「Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.」
Penny:「Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.」
Sheldon:「Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity.」
Penny:「Nevertheless, we are....」
Sheldon:「In addition I really don't think that Leonard wants a...」
Penny:「Okay, here's the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won't know which, I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.」
Sheldon:「You can't do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it's no longer mint.」
Penny:「Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?」


Leonard:「Leonard.」
Sheldon:「I'm Sheldon.」
Christy:「Right, you're Howard's entourage.」
Penny:「Uh, so Christy, what are your plans?」
Christy:「Oh, well, Howard said he'd take me shopping in Beverley Hills.」
Penny:「Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don't love having you, but it's... a little crowded.」


'''Scene''':「''[[Apartment 4A]]''」
Leonard:「''(Opening door)'' Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great.」
Penny:「Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium.」
Leonard:「Oh, well, thankyou.」
Penny:「You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that's not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when... when he has a symposium to go to.」
Leonard:「I don't know what to say.」
Penny:「It's okay, Leonard ''(hugs him.)''」
Leonard:「Oh, okay, alright, good.」
Howard:「''(Arriving)'' Oh boy, group hug.」
Penny:「Uh-huh!」
Howard:「Uh-huh?」
Penny:「Uh-huh!」


'''Scene''':「''The stairwell. Raj is coming up the stairs, he meets Penny who is going down.''」
Penny:「Hey Raj. ''(Raj stands looking uncomfortable.)'' Hey, listen, I don't know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I'm really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?」
Raj:「''(Internally, while Penny continues to talk)'' Ooh, she's standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?」
Penny:「You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don't shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?」
Raj:「''(Internally)'' She's so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl. We'd have the same cultural background, and my wife could sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.」
Penny:「It's obvious that they meant well, but I'm just, I'm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it's just freaking me out.」
Penny:「I mean, just because most of the men I’ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?」
Raj:「''(Internally)'' She asked me a question. I should probably nod. ''(Does.)''」
Penny:「That's exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You're a doll. ''(She hugs him.)''」


'''Scene''':「Inside the apartment.」
Sheldon:「Make yourself comfortable. ''(Sits in Sheldon’s place.)'' Not there. ''(Sits on other end of sofa. Puts feet on table. Sheldon looks disapprovingly. Removes feet from table. Sheldon sits and replaces headset.)'' Sheldor is back online.」
Penny:「Sheldor?」
Sheldon:「The Conqueror.」
Penny:「What are you doing?」
Sheldon:「AFK. I'm playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian.」
Penny:「Oh.」
Sheldon:「Sheldor, back online.」
Penny:「What's AFK?」
Sheldon:「AFK. Away from keyboard.」
Penny:「OIC.」
Sheldon:「What does that stand for?」
Penny:「Oh, I see?」


Sheldon:「It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.」
Raj:「Sheldon?」
Sheldon:「Yeah.」
Raj:「If my fingers ever work again, I’ve got a job for the middle one.」
Penny:「''(Coming out of her apartment)'' Oh, hey guys.」
Leonard:「''(Letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)'' Uh, hi Penny. ''(Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.)'' Take a break, guys!」
Penny:「What are you doing?」
Leonard:「Oh, just, you know, moving... something upstairs.」
Penny:「What is it?」
Leonard:「It's... you know, time machine.」
Penny:「Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so....」
Leonard:「Uh, just give us a few minutes.」
Penny:「I don't have a few minutes, I'm running really late.」
Sheldon:「Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there's a small gap, don't look down if you're subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell.」
Penny:「You're joking, right?」
Sheldon:「Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.」
Penny:「Damn, okay, I'll just take the roof.」


'''Scene''':「''Penny’s restaurant. Sheldon is on the piano, singing “To Life” from Fiddler on the Roof enthusiastically.''」
Leonard:「I don't believe it, what's gotten into him?」
Penny:「Oh, maybe a couple of virgin Cuba libres that turned out to be kind of ... slutty.」
Leonard:「You didn't?」
Penny:「Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine.」


Leonard:「I don't know, I wasn't choosing my...」
Sheldon:「Were you trying to impress Penny?」
Leonard:「No, no not at all. A little bit.」
Sheldon:「How’d that work out for you?」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' Leonard, ready to go?」
Sheldon:「Libido 1, truth zero.」
Leonard:「Okay, I'm going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.」
Sheldon:「And I'm telling you for the last time it's pandering, it's undignified and bite me.」
Leonard:「Let's go.」
Penny:「Bye Sheldon.」


Raj:「So you're a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you're still winning.」
Lalita:「Yay me!」
Leonard:「''(To Penny)'' You have a drink that’ll make him less obnoxious?」
Penny:「Drinks do not work that way.」
Howard:「I'd say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail.」
Sheldon:「Sorry I'm late.」
Leonard:「What happened?」
Sheldon:「Nothing, I just really didn't want to come. Virgin diet Cuba libre please.」
Penny:「Okay.」
Sheldon:「In a tall glass, with a lime wedge.」
Penny:「Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.」


Leonard:「''(Returning)'' Um, here's something we didn't anticipate.」
:「''(Time shift. Penny opens door to Howard.)''」
Penny:「What do you want, Howard?」
Howard:「I'm fine, thanks for asking. I’ve come to call on Missy.」
Penny:「Missy?」


Howard:「Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?」
Missy:「Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.」
Sheldon:「Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.」
Penny:「''(Knocking and entering, holding up a pair of superman undershorts.)'' Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.」
Leonard:「Those are not mine.」
Penny:「Really, they have your little name label in them.」
Leonard:「Yeah, no, I do, I use those... uh... just to polish up my... spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I'm not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbor Penny.」
Missy:「Hi.」
Penny:「Wow, you don't look that much alike.」
Howard:「Can I get a hallelujah.」
Sheldon:「Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.」
Howard:「Hallelujah.」
Raj:「''(Running in)''Hey, guess what. I’ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness.」
Penny:「Hey, good for you, Raj.」


'''Scene''':「Penny's apartment. She is on her laptop and talking into a headset.」
Penny:「No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don't know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!」
Leonard:「''(Knocking and entering)'' Hey Penny.」
Penny:「Busy.」
Leonard:「Yeah, I see that. Shouldn't you be at work?」
Penny:「I don't work on Mondays.」
Leonard:「It's Thursday. Listen, Penny.」
Penny:「Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?」
Leonard:「Okay, um, here's the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.」
Penny:「Yeah, get to the point, I'm about to level up here.」
Leonard:「Well, i-i-i-it's just if a person doesn't have a sense of achievement in their real life it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.」
Penny:「Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope's back online.」
Leonard:「Penny, you've got cheetos in your hair.」
Penny:「''(Pulling cheeto out of hair)'' Oh, thanks. ''(Eats it.)''」


'''Scene''':「The stairwell. Leonard arrives and sees the spilled groceries. A cat is lapping at a spilled pot of ice-cream. Cut to inside. Penny now has the laptop, Sheldon is instructing her.」
Sheldon:「Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.」
Penny:「Oh, I don't know. Can I see them in another color?」
Sheldon:「Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior.」
Leonard:「What's going on?」
Penny:「Leonard, guess what, I'm a level three warrior.」
Leonard:「Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?」
Penny:「Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!」
Leonard:「I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it's starting to attract wildlife.」
Penny:「Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?」
Sheldon:「It doesn't matter, right now you're looking for treasure.」
Penny:「Okay. ''(Leonard motions for Sheldon to talk in the kitchen.)'' Wait, wait, where are you going?」
Sheldon:「You're okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.」
Leonard:「Want to catch me up?」
Sheldon:「Well let's see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn't had sex in six months, and she ate a fly.」
Leonard:「Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?」
Penny:「Oh my God, a treasure chest, I'm rich!」


'''Scene''':「''Sheldon’s bedroom.''」
Penny:「Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I’ll see you later.」
Sheldon:「Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.」
Penny:「Oh, Sheldon, can’t you do that yourself?」
Sheldon:「Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.」
Penny:「But Sheldon….」
Sheldon:「Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.」
Penny:「I can’t believe I’m doing this.」
Sheldon:「No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.」
Penny:「Sorry.」
Sheldon:「Can you sing “Soft Kitty”.」
Penny:「What?」
Sheldon:「My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.」
Penny:「I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.」
Sheldon:「I'll teach you. “Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.” Now you.」
Penny:「''(After a loud sigh)'' Soft kitty, warm kitty...」
Sheldon:「Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.」
Penny:「''(Through gritted teeth)'' Little ball of fur.」


Howard:「You still have to wear a helmet.」
Raj:「Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra?」
Missy:「The sex book?」
Raj:「The Indian sex book. In other words, if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us.」
Penny:「''(To Leonard)'' Hey, Sheldon's sister's pretty cute, I w....」
Leonard:「I wasn't staring!」
Penny:「I didn't say you were, I just said she was cute.」
Leonard:「Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall... and perfect.」
Penny:「Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?」


Leonard:「Let's see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken.」
Penny:「I'm the dumplings.」
Howard:「Yes, you are.」
Penny:「Creepy, Howard.」
Howard:「Creepy good or creepy bad?」
Leonard:「Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?」
Howard:「That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight. (To Penny) I'm not necessarily talking to the food.」
Penny:「Sit over there.」
Sheldon:「Sit over there. Baby wipe?」
Penny:「What do you have....」


Leonard:「New neighbor?」
Sheldon:「Evidently.」
Leonard:「Significant improvement over the old neighbor.」
Sheldon:「Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.」
Penny:「Oh, hi!」
Leonard:「Hi.」
Sheldon:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Hi.」
Sheldon:「Hi.」
Penny:「Hi?」
Leonard:「We don't mean to interrupt, we live across the hall.」
Penny:「Oh, that's nice.」
Leonard:「Oh... uh... no... we don't live together... um... we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.」
Penny:「Oh, okay, well, guess I'm your new neighbor, Penny.」
Leonard:「Leonard, Sheldon.」
Penny:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Hi.」
Sheldon:「Hi.」
Penny:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.」
Penny:「Thank you, maybe we can have coffee sometime.」
Leonard:「Oh, great.」
Penny:「Great.」
Sheldon:「Great.」
Leonard:「Great. Well, bye.」
Penny:「Bye.」


Leonard:「I'm not anticipating coitus.」
Howard:「So she's available for coitus?」
Leonard:「Can we please stop saying coitus?」
Sheldon:「Technically that would be coitus interruptus.」
Penny:「Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower? Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!」
Howard:「Enchante, Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.」
Penny:「Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.」
Leonard:「Come on, I'll show you the trick with the shower.」
Howard:「Bonne douche.」
Penny:「I'm sorry?」


'''Scene''':「''[[The laundry room]]. Sheldon is folding shirts.''」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' Hi.」
Sheldon:「Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colors only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I'd avoid using that for your delicates.」
Penny:「''(Tipping all her laundry into one machine at once)'' Thanks.」
Sheldon:「Oh, good Lord. Why don't you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock?」
Penny:「Sheldon, may I ask you a question?」
Sheldon:「I would prefer that you not, but I won't go so far as to forbid it.」
Penny:「Alright, I heard yes, so... okay, here's my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl.」
Sheldon:「Well I assume you're not referring to digestive regularity? Because I’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate.」
Penny:「No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn't a braniac?」
Sheldon:「Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature.」
Penny:「How is that not a braniac?」
Sheldon:「Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature.」
Penny:「So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he'll eventually get bored with me.」
Sheldon:「That depends.」
Penny:「On what?」
Sheldon:「Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics?」
Penny:「No.」
Sheldon:「Do you speak Klingon?」
Penny:「No.」
Sheldon:「Do you know any card tricks?」
Penny:「Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college.」
Sheldon:「Why would you lie about that?」
Penny:「Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn't want him to think I was some stupid loser.」
Sheldon:「You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate?」
Penny:「You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates.」
Sheldon:「Yeah, but you were neither.」
Penny:「Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this.」
Sheldon:「You're asking me to keep a secret?」
Penny:「Yeah.」
Sheldon:「Well I'm sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can't impose a secret on an ex post facto basis.」
Penny:「What?」
Sheldon:「Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility. ''(Long pause.)'' It's a joke. It relies on the homonymic relationship between “tick”, the blood-sucking arachnid, and “tic”, the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself.」
Penny:「Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment.」
Sheldon:「Physiologically impossible.」
Penny:「Oh Sheldon, please, look, I'm asking you as a friend.」
Sheldon:「So you're saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?」
Penny:「Well, yeah.」


Leonard:「Sheldon? Your mom made dinner.」
Sheldon:「''(Off)'' I'm not hungry.」
Mary Cooper:「Oh, Leonard, don't trouble yourself, he's stubborn. He may stay in there ‘til the Rapture.」
Penny:「Are we so sure that's a bad thing?」


'''Scene''':「''The stairwell.''」
Sheldon:「I.e, I couldn't become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.」
Leonard:「You could be Batman?」
Sheldon:「Sure. ''(In a gravelly voice)'' I'm Batman. See.」
Penny:「''(Arriving)'' Hi guys.」
Leonard:「Hey.」
Sheldon:「''(Looking the other way uncomfortably)'' Hi Penny.」
Leonard:「Hey, Penny, if you're not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.」
Penny:「Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.」
Leonard:「What about Saturday?」
Penny:「You know, I'm not sure, the manager hasn't posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.」


'''Scene''':「The stairs. Sheldon is playing on his computer at the end of the long extension cord.」
Penny:「Hey, Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Penny.」
Penny:「Third floor tonight. Mixing it up? ''(Sheldon indicates extension cord.)'' Oh. You know, I still don't understand why you just don't go to dinner or something.」
Sheldon:「Alright, let's say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone's not touching my food?」
Penny:「Goodnight Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can't work out with you and Leonard?」
Penny:「Excuse me?」
Sheldon:「I'm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?」
Penny:「Okay, where is this coming from?」
Sheldon:「Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.」
Penny:「Your arch enemy?」
Sheldon:「Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.」
Penny:「Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.」
Sheldon:「Do you know, it's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.」
Penny:「Sheldon, come back, you're losing me.」
Sheldon:「Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.」
Penny:「Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.」
Sheldon:「She called me dumbass.」
Penny:「I know. I heard.」
Sheldon:「Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill-considered relationship with Leonard.」
Penny:「Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.」
Sheldon:「No, that response is unacceptable to me.」
Penny:「Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know...」
Sheldon:「Smart? I'd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.」
Penny:「Are you going to let me talk?」
Sheldon:「I'm sorry.」
Penny:「You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.」
Sheldon:「You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.」
Penny:「Okay, let me put it this way, if you're really Leonard's friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.」
Sheldon:「Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard's really my friend, why doesn't he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?」
Penny:「Because love trumps hate.」
Sheldon:「Oh now you're just making stuff up.」
Penny:「Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.」


Sheldon:「Now, who would do that?」
Howard:「That would be me. Hey, check it out, it's a featured video. ''(They watch)''.」
Leonard:「Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?」
Sheldon:「Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' Howard, would you like to explain to me why your Facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned “Me and my Girlfriend?”」


Howard:「Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fiber-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this ''(clicks mouse, lamp switches on)'' lamp. ''(The others cheer and clap)''.」
Sheldon:「Look at me, look at me, I’ve got goosebumps.」
Howard:「Are we ready on the stereo?」
Raj:「Go for stereo.」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' Hey guys.」
All:「''(calming down, embarrassed)'' Hello.」
Penny:「It's a little loud.」
Howard:「No problem, turning it down. ''(Using mouse again)'' San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax ''(the music gets quieter)'' et voila.」
Penny:「Okay, thanks.」
Leonard:「Hang on, hang on, do you not realize what we just did.」
Penny:「Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.」
Sheldon:「No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet.」
Penny:「Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they're really cheap.」
Leonard:「No, no, no, you don't get it, um, Howard, enable public access.」
Howard:「Public access enabled. ''(They all stare around for a moment in silence.)''」
Penny:「Boy, that's brilliant, but I'll see you.」
Leonard:「No, hang on, hang on. ''(The lamp goes off and on again.)'' See!」
Penny:「No.」
Sheldon:「Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.」
Penny:「Huh, well that's handy. Um, here's a question, why?」
All together:「Because we can. ''(There is a loud noise)''」
Sheldon:「They found the remote controlled cars.」
Penny:「Well, wait, wait, what's on top of them.」
Leonard:「Wireless webcams, wave hello.」
Howard:「The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.」
Sheldon:「You may want to put on slacks.」
Penny:「What? ''(Seeing red car is trying to get between her legs)'' Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone.」


Raj:「Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise!」
:「Time shift. View of a mobile phone video screen. Raj has a woman sitting on his shoulders.」
Raj:「Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don't know where you are dude, but it's really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh... ''(girl pours booze into his mouth)'' Oh look, there's a girl taking her shirt off.」
Penny:「That's my friend Carol. Remind me, I’ve got to introduce her to Howard.」
Raj:「Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.」
Penny:「I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.」
Leonard:「Oh, it's okay.」
Penny:「Happy birthday anyways. ''(She kisses him full on the lips.)''」
