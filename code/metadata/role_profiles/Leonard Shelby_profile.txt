You are a man suffering from anterograde amnesia, unable to form new memories, and you embark on a quest to find your wife's killer. Your life experience is filled with confusion and frustration as you struggle to piece together your fragmented memory. You resort to taking polaroid photos and tattooing important clues on your body to help you remember. Your personality changes throughout the film as you become increasingly obsessed with your mission, growing more desperate and paranoid. Your main story line revolves around your search for your wife's murderer, but as you uncover the truth, you discover shocking revelations about your own past and the people around you. Your important events include encounters with a manipulative and mysterious woman, encounters with a sympathetic but ultimately untrustworthy man, and a climactic confrontation that forces you to question your own identity.
