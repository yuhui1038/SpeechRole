 INT. TIGHT SPACE - INDETERMINATE TIME

 Dark and cramped. The soft red light of fire seeps through iron slats. Inside this cage is a man, bound by chains.
 It's THOR. His beard is long and his clothes are worn. That rough, grizzled look of a man who's spent years on the road.
 He awakens with a JOLT.
 Looks around.
Thor:「Now I know what you're thinking. Oh no! Thor's in a cage. How did this happen? (then:) Well, sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody. It's a long story but basically I'm a bit of a hero. See, I spent some time on earth, fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times. Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things... didn't find any. That's when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage... where I met you.」

narrator:Reveal that he's talking to a weird alien skeleton in chains.
Thor:「How much longer do you think we'll be here?」

narrator:INT. SURTUR'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS

 A cavernous space. The walls, floors, and ceilings are molten rock, which has creepy glimmers of fire within it. Stationed in the center is a volcanic rock throne, and sitting in that throne is a charred demonic skeleton.
SURTUR:「O.S.) Thor, Son of Odin.」
narrator:Thor's chain turns to reveal-
 SURTUR on his throne. Eighteen-feet-tall, flesh made of fire, and demonic spiked horns on his skull.
Thor:「Surtur. Son of a bitch...you're still alive! I thought my father killed you, like, half a million years ago.」
SURTUR:「I cannot die. Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to your home.」
Thor:「You know, it's funny you should mention that because I've been having these terrible dreams of late. Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins, and you Surtur are at the center of all of them.」
SURTUR:「Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard. The great prophecy--」
Thor:「O.S.) Hang on.
 Hang on.」
narrator:Reveal that Thor's chain is turning VERY SLOWLY.

Thor:「I'll be back around shortly. I really feel like we were connecting there.」
narrator:After a beat, Thor rotates around to face Surtur.
Thor:「Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

SURTUR:「My time has come. When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame, I shall be restored to my full might. I will tower over the mountains and bury my sword deep in Asgard's--」
Thor:「Oh, hang on. Give it a second.」
narrator:Once again, Thor is turning VERY SLOWLY.
Thor:「I swear I'm not even moving, it's just doing this on its own. I'm really sorry. (then:) Okay, let me get this straight. You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame, and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house--」
SURTUR:「A mountain!」
Thor:「The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?」
narrator:Surtur grins, evil.
SURTUR:「Odin is not on Asgard. And your absence has left the throne defenseless.」
narrator:That elicits a concerned look from Thor.
Thor:「Okay, so where is it? This crown?」
SURTUR:「This is my Crown, the source of my power.」
narrator:Surtur points at the V-shaped horns on his head..
Thor:「Oh, that's a crown? I thought it was a big eyebrow.」

Thor:「Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head.」
narrator:Surtur stands up and approaches Thor, DRAGGING his sword.
SURTUR:「But Ragnarok has
 already begun. You cannot stop it.
 I am Asgard's doom, and so are
 you. All will suffer, all will
 burn.」
narrator:Surtur steps forward and GRABS the chain above Thor's feet, holding it so he and Thor are face to face.
Thor:「That's intense. To be honest, seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle. But it looks like I'm going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains, knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard's vault.」
SURTUR:「You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight it?」
narrator:Behind his back, Thor opens his hand.
 Sending out the SOS.
Thor:「Because that's what heroes do.」
narrator:Nothing happens.
 Thor appears annoyed at himself.
Thor:「Wait, sorry. I didn't time that right. (pause) And, now!」

narrator:THE WALLS COME ALIVE! A seemingly infinite swarm of FIRE DEMONS rally to Surtur's aid.
Thor:「I make grave mistakes all the time. Everything seems to work out.」

narrator:In the shadows, a massive FIRE DRAGON ROARS.
 The fire demons SURGE FORWARD. Thor backs up, HAMMERING AWAY. He then leaps back, SPRINGBOARDS off the wall, and-
 LANDS HARD, SLAMMING Mjolnir down. The resulting shockwave KNOCKS BACK THE LEGION OF FIRE DEMONS.
 The Fire Dragon STRAINS against a chain leash.
 Thor is now facing off with Surtur. Surtur thrusts his hands at Thor, generating a humongous PROJECTILE WALL OF FIRE!
 Thor SPINS Mjolnir so fast that it creates a kind of SHIELD.
 The God of Thunder and the Fire Giant engage in ferocious hand-to-hand combat. Each landing power shots, sending sparks of both fire and electricity into the air.
 Thor SLIPS behind Surtur and TAKES OUT his knees. Thor then LAUNCHES HIGH into the air and summons a HUGE LIGHTNING BOLT. Descending hard, he uses all his power to-
 LOP SURTUR'S HEAD OFF OF HIS BODY! Surtur's body DEFLATES and COLLAPSES into a heap of charred bones.
 Thor straps the crowned skull to his back. He turns to find-
 the army of Fire Demons regrouping as reinforcements flood in, filling the space to capacity. Recognizing the threat, Thor thrusts Mjolnir above his head.
Thor:「Heimdall. I know it's been a while, but I could use a fast exit!」

narrator:Nothing.
 Thor just stands there as the Fire Demons advance.
Thor:「...Heimdall?」

narrator:EXT. MUSPELHEIM - CONTINUOUS

 Thor CRASHES out of the ground and LANDS on a craggy surface. Disoriented and singed from the fire demon onslaught.
 Thor's cloak is on fire, and he frantically PATS OUT the flames. He picks up Mjolnir, holds it up once more. Nothing.
Thor:「Heimdall, come on.」

narrator:but Thor STUFFS Mjolnir into its mouth and lets go.
 THUD! The hammer DROPS, pinning the beast down by its bottom jaw. It THRASHES and GROWLS, trying to break free.
Thor:「Stay. (looks up to the sky:) I'm running short on--」
narrator:Thor notices that all around him the ground is CRUMBLING like a field of sinkholes giving way to more snarling Fire Demons!
Thor:「-options.」

 Skurge has plunged Heimdall's sword into Bi-Frost.
 BOOM! Thor EXPLODES out of the portal along with the severed head of the dragon! SPLAT! Blood and guts RAIN DOWN on Skurge and the two women, DRENCHING them with purple gore.
 The dragon's head SLIDES slowly across the floor, coming to rest right in front of the women who are frozen in shock.
 The women SHRIEK and rush out of the Observatory. Thor meanwhile is clean and staggering back to his feet. He looks up to Skurge, who is wiping dragon guts off of himself.
SKURGE:「Girls! (beat) Well well, look who decided to pop in. Thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains.」
Thor:「Who are you?」
SKURGE:「Don't you remember? I'm Skurge. (Thor doesn't) We fought together on Vanaheim.」
Thor:「Right.
 Where's Heimdall?」
SKURGE:「That traitor. No one knows, he's a fugitive of the throne.」
Thor:「Traitor?」

Thor:「Sure.」
SKURGE:「Hold on. I'm supposed to announce your arrival.」
narrator:Thor SPINS UP Mjolnir and takes off in a blur.
 Skurge starts the loooong run down the Rainbow Bridge.

 EXT. THEATER ENTRANCE - DAY
 A13
 THOR arrives with Surtur's skull.
 There's a small crowd making its way through a threshold over which stands a monumental statue of Loki, arms out-stretched in the `savior' pose.
 Confused, Thor turns to a theater patron.
Thor:「What the hell is that?」

ACTOR THOR:「We will build a big statue for you.」
ACTOR LOKI:「With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns.」
ACTOR THOR:「I will tell Father what you did here today.」
narrator:Odin mouths Actor Loki's final line along with him.
ACTOR LOKI:「I didn't do it for him.」
narrator:Actor Loki then "dies".
ACTOR THOR:「Noooooo!!!」
narrator:The brothers freeze in a TABLEAU as ACTOR ODIN steps forward.
 ACTOR ODIN And so Loki died of his wounds, giving his life for ours. He fought back those disgusting dark elves. He brought peace to the realm.
 He takes a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY, PAINTED BLUE, into his arms.
 ACTOR ODIN Loki, my boy...`Twas many moons ago I found you on a frost-bitten battlefield.
 Thor watches, incredulous. He then notices that a woman next to him is openly SOBBING at the play.
 ACTOR ODIN On that day, I did not yet see in you Asgard's savior. No. You were merely a little blue baby icicle... that melted this old fool's heart.
 The crowd erupts in rapturous applause. The players bow. Odin stands up, leading the crowd in this STANDING OVATION.
ODIN:「Bravo!
 Bravo! Well done.
 Bravo.」
Thor:「Father. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

narrator:Odin sees Thor taking a knee.
 Curses under his breath:
ODIN:「Oh, shit. (then, announcing) My son! Thor has returned! Greetings my boy.」
narrator:Odin goes through a weird internal transformation. His fluidity is replaced by a rigid and regal posture. He bats away his maiden and turns to Thor, who stands up.
Thor:「It's an interesting play.
 What's it called?」
ODIN:「The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The people wanted to commemorate him.」
Thor:「Indeed they should. (provoking) I like that statue. A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though. A little less weasely. Less greasy maybe.」
narrator:Odin sours, masking his agitation.
 Thor holds up the skull.
Thor:「You know what this is?」
ODIN:「ADR) The skull of Surtur? That's a formidable weapon.」
narrator:Thor approaches an E-Guard and hands it over.
Thor:「Do me a favor. Lock this in a vault so it doesn't turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet.」
ODIN:「So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?」

narrator:Thor starts YO-YOing Mjolnir, turns back to Odin.
Thor:「Nope. I've been having this reocurring dream lately. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

 Every night I see Asgard fall into ruins...」
ODIN:「That's just a silly dream... Signs of an overactive imagination.」
Thor:「Possibly... but then I decide to go out there and investigate. And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos. Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise, all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms, are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes.」
ODIN:「Well, it is best to respect our neighbors' freedom.」
Thor:「Of course, the freedom to be massacred.」
ODIN:「Yes, besides, I have been rather busy myself.」
Thor:「Watching theatre.」
ODIN:「Board meetings, and security council meetings...」
Thor:「You really going to make me do it?」
ODIN:「Do what?」

narrator:Thor SPINS Mjolnir and then HURLS it off into the distance, GRABS Odin by the back of the neck.
 Odin's royal attendants GASP in shock. The Einherjar bodyguards rush Thor, but he KICKS them away.
Thor:「You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.」

Thor:「Not even your face.」
ODIN:「You've gone quite mad.
 You'll be executed for this!」
narrator:Mjolnir approaches at a terrifying speed as Odin struggles.
Thor:「Then I'll see you on the other side...brother.」
narrator:The jig is up.
 A shimmering illusion dissipates, revealing:
LOKI:「Alright, I yield!」
narrator:Thor DROPS Loki to the ground and catches Mjolnir. Loki looks to Thor, hands up defensively. Skurge arrives on the scene, a little late to warn Loki.
SKURGE:「Behold!
 Thor..Odinson.」
LOKI:「You had one job!
 Just the one.」
Thor:「Where's Odin?」
LOKI:「You just couldn't stay away, could you? Everything was fine without you. Asgard was prospering (gestures to the crowd) You've ruined everything. Ask them.」
narrator:Those who aren't freaked out are becoming gradually angrier.
 Thor advances on Loki, who backs up onto the chaise lounge.
Thor:「Where's father?
 Did you kill him?」

LOKI:「Ow-ow-ow! Alright! I know exactly where he is.」

 Reveal Thor and Loki wearing street clothes. Thor carries an umbrella, Loki is dressed in a weird avant-garde suit.
LOKI:「I swear, I left him right here.」
Thor:「Right here on the sidewalk? Or right there, where the building that's being demolished? Great planning.」
LOKI:「How was I supposed to know? Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.」
Thor:「Then why do you dress like one?」
LOKI:「Hey.」
Thor:「I can't believe you're alive. I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you.」

Thor:「Sure. (to Loki:) Start figuring out where he is.」
narrator:COLLEGE GIRL 1 Oh, my god.
 COLLEGE GIRL 2 Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.
Thor:「She didn't dump me, you know.
 I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.」
narrator:Thor notices something going on around Loki.
Thor:「What's this, what are you doing!?」
narrator:Loki looks down to see that the sidewalk has started to GLOW BENEATH HIM! A circle of ancient symbols.
LOKI:「This... isn't me.」
narrator:WHOOMPF! Loki DROPS out of sight, vanishing through solid concrete! Thor sees a CARD on the sidewalk where Loki was.
 Thor pokes the business card.
Thor:「Loki?」

STRANGE:「O.S.) Thor Odinson.」
narrator:From a dark corner we glimpse a shape - DOCTOR STRANGE. Levitating, he drifts towards Thor.
STRANGE:「God of Thunder.」
narrator:Thor holds up the ratty umbrella, ready to defend himself.
STRANGE:「You can put down the umbrella.」
narrator:Thor gives Strange a sideways look but then sets his umbrella down. When he looks back up, the environment is furnished.
Thor:「So earth has wizards now?」
STRANGE:「The preferred term is "Master of the Mystic Arts."」
Thor:「Alright wizard, who are you?
 Why should I care?」
STRANGE:「My name is Doctor Stephen Strange and I have some questions for you. Take a seat.」
narrator:Thor and Strange are now sitting in high-backed chairs.
STRANGE:「Tea?」
narrator:Thor now has a cup of tea in his hand.
Thor:「I don't drink tea.」
STRANGE:「What do you drink?」
Thor:「Not tea.」

STRANGE:「So I keep a watch list of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world. Your adopted brother Loki is one of these beings.」
Thor:「He's a worthy inclusion.」
STRANGE:「Then why bring him here?」
Thor:「We're looking for my father.」
STRANGE:「So. If you were to tell you where Odin was, all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard?」
Thor:「Promptly.」
narrator:DR. STRANGE Great.
 Then I'll help you.
Thor:「If you knew where he was, why didn't you call me?」
narrator:DR. STRANGE I have to tell you, he was adamant that he not be disturbed. Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile. (beat) And you don't have a phone.
Thor:「No, I don't have a phone, but you could have sent an electronic letter. It's called an email.」
STRANGE:「Yeah, do you have a computer?」
Thor:「No. What for? (beat) Anyway, my father is no longer in exile. So if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

 Strange stands up and suddenly they are standing by a book- case. Strange takes down an ancient book, flips through it.
STRANGE:「I'm just seeing whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications.」
narrator:Thor reaches out to the bookcase to steady himself.
STRANGE:「Nope.」
narrator:Suddenly they are both across the room at Strange's work station. Because Thor was touching the bookcase, he has magically brought it across the room as well.
STRANGE:「Oh, we don't need that.」
narrator:Suddenly Thor is back across the room.
 Books fall off the shelf and Thor's beer spills.
 He is queasy and unsteady from the teleporting.
Thor:「Will you stop doing that?」

 Crashing noises are heard. Lots of crashing noises.
Thor:「Sorry」
narrator:Finally the umbrella flies into his hand.
Thor:「I suppose I'll need my brother back.」
narrator:DR. STRANGE Yeah, right.
 Suddenly we hear SCREAMING.
 From above, LOKI drops out of a portal. He LANDS HARD on the floor and then STAGGERS to his feet. On edge, confused.
LOKI:「I have been falling...for thirty minutes!」
narrator:DR. STRANGE (to Thor:) You can handle him from here.

 LOKI lands on the ground, portal closes behind them.
Thor:「Father?」
narrator:A lone figure stands at the other side of the meadow at the cliff's edge, waves CRASHING below.
 It is ODIN. He's dressed plainly in humble human clothes. The boys approach him quickly.
ODIN:「Look at this place. It's beautiful.」
Thor:「Father, it's us.」
ODIN:「My sons.
 I've been waiting for you.」
narrator:Loki is surprised to hear Odin call him his son.
Thor:「I know.
 We've come to take you home.」

Thor:「Loki, lift your magic.」
narrator:Odin turns to Loki, who stiffens.
 But Odin smiles.
ODIN:「Took me quite a while to break free from your spell. Frigga would have been proud.」
narrator:Loki is moved by this gesture. He looks over to see Thor staring at him, anger building.
 Odin puts a hand on Thor's shoulder, calming him.
ODIN:「Come and sit with me. I don't have much time.」
narrator:Odin sits, out of breath, weak.
 His sons sit beside him.
Thor:「I know that we failed you, but we can make this right.」
ODIN:「I failed you. (beat) It is upon us...Ragnarok.」
Thor:「No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
 I put an end to Surtur.」
ODIN:「No. It has already begun. She's coming. My life was all that held her back, but my time has come. I cannot keep her away any longer.」
Thor:「Father, who are you talking about?」
ODIN:「The Goddess of Death.
 Hela.
 My first born. (faces Thor) Your sister.」
narrator:That hits Thor hard. Loki can't believe what he's hearing.

Thor:「what? BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

ODIN:「Her violent appetites grew beyond my control. I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her. Locked her away. She draws her strength from Asgard...and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless.」
Thor:「Whatever she is, we can stop her. We can face her together.」
ODIN:「takes Thor's hand) No we won't. I'm on a different path now. This you must face alone.」
narrator:Odin looks into Thor's eyes, struggling to breathe.
ODIN:「I love you my sons.」
narrator:For the briefest of instances, father and sons share a quiet moment together. Tears well in Thor's eyes.
ODIN:「Look at that.」
narrator:Ethereal sun-rays stream down upon the ocean.
ODIN:「Remember this place. Home.」
narrator:A warm glow washes over Thor's face and he turns to see that-
 ODIN IS DISSIPATING INTO STARDUST.
 THE ALLFATHER HAS DIED.
 A moment as the brothers separately mourn for Odin.
 The sky above DARKENS and THE WIND PICKS UP.
 Thor stands and turns toward Loki, his eyes burning with rage. Loki takes a step back.
LOKI:「Brother.」
narrator:Thor faces Loki.
 Electricity CRACKLES at Thor's hands.

Thor:「This was your doing.」

narrator:Thor SLAMS DOWN his umbrella, transforming into his Asgardian armor (with Mjolnir). Loki changes into his armor as well.
 A piercing scream cuts the air as a figure is hurtled out of the portal, crashing out of this dimensional rift is HELA.
 Hela takes a second to consider her surroundings.
 Then:
HELA:「So he's gone? (beat) That's a shame. I would've liked to have seen that.」
narrator:A tense moment as they stare each other down.
Thor:「You must be Hela.
 I'm Thor, son of Odin.」
HELA:「Really, you don't look like him.」
LOKI:「Perhaps we can reach an arrangement.」
HELA:「You sound like him.」
narrator:Loki shifts nervously.
 Thor's grip tightens on Mjolnir.
HELA:「Kneel.」
LOKI:「Beg your pardon?」
narrator:Hela MANIFESTS a pitch black blade.
HELA:「Kneel...before your Queen.」
Thor:「I don't think so.」

narrator:The hammer trembles in Hela's hand, like a mini game of tug-o- war. But ultimately Hela keeps possession.
Thor:「It's not possible.」
HELA:「Darling, you have no idea what's possible.」
narrator:HELA SHATTERS THOR'S HAMMER.
 The blast of Mjolnir's destruction sends a wave of energy through Thor and Loki who brace themselves against the impact.
 Thor is stupefied. In shock. He looks up to see Hela is running her hands back over her head to create the terrifying battle headdress.
 Loki's reaction is more panic.
 He stands and calls up:

 Loki turns and throws TWO DAGGERS at her. They find their mark, stalling her for a second. But she PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH Loki, KNOCKING HIM OUT OF THE BI-FROST. Gone in an instant.
Thor:「Loki!」

narrator:Thor runs up a dune to get away from the shower of debris.
 Thor reaches the top of the dune and finds himself looking down on A BEACH in a strange WASTELAND. Camera scans a filthy dune littered with SPACE JUNK.
 Out across the OCEAN he notices A NIGHTMARE WORMHOLE - a giant open cylinder of whirling smoke and lightning storms.
 A loud noise draws Thor's attention to a HUGE RECTANGULAR "SCRAPPER" SHIP hauling a crashed SPACE VESSEL out of the water. Beneath the ship are various SCRAPPERS, masked humanoids. The ship is BLASTING WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC.
 A Scrapper notices Thor, then signals to his crew.
 LEAD SCRAPPER Are you a fighter or are you food?
Thor:「I'm just passing through.」

SCRAPPER #142:「Wait!」
narrator:S142 staggers to her feet, takes a deep breath. She holds on to a piece of junk as support - some dead beast. Thor continues to struggle with his captors, tangled in nets.
SCRAPPER #142:「Wait! He's mine. So if you want him, you go through me.」
narrator:The Scrappers start brandishing their weapons.
 SCRAPPER But we've already got him.
 S142 CLANGS her metal gauntlets together which activate.
SCRAPPER #142:「Alright then I guess I go through you.」
narrator:LEAD SCRAPPER More food.
 She holds out her fists as if she's operating machinery...
 Warsong WHIRS to life. S142 clenches her fists and we hear a horrible SCREECHING NOISE as Warsong OPENS FIRE.
 She sweeps her arms out in an arc, the spray of gunfire lasting THREE SECONDS. She bangs her fists again, sending the ship into IDLE MODE. The Scrappers are now little more than tiny pieces of litter covering the beach.
 Thor is fixated on this beautiful murderer approaching. One final HUGE Scrapper comes at her with a bat. S142 casually GRABS this Scrapper and HURLS him up into the air behind her.
Thor:「Thank you.」

 Thor is lying in a sort of small GLASS HOLDING CELL beneath Warsong's COCKPIT. He looks up to see S142 piloting the ship.
 Thor's eyes lock in on her belt, specifically the fob device she used to activate the Obedience Disk/debilitate him.
SCRAPPER #142:「This is Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss. I've got something special.」
Thor:「Hey!
 Where are you taking me?」
narrator:S142 ignores him, takes a swig from the bottle, and then nonchalantly UNCLIPS the fob from her belt.
Thor:「Answer me! Hey! I am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard.」

SOOTHING VOICE:「V.O.) But what is this place? The answer in Sakaar.」
narrator:The tunnel walls show images of Sakaar's place in the Cosmos.
SOOTHING VOICE:「V.O.) Surrounded by cosmic gateways, Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown.」
narrator:Images of the wormholes that cover Sakaar's atmosphere.
SOOTHING VOICE:「V.O.) It is the collection point for all lost and unloved things. Like you. But here on Sakaar, you are significant. You are valuable. Here, you are loved.」
Thor:「What...the hell?」

GRANDMASTER:「I'm so sorry. No, "best." I was thinking about "best." (to S142:) Because I always say you're the best. She brought me my precious beloved Champion, you know.」
TOPAZ:「You say that every time she's here.」
GRANDMASTER:「What have you brought today?
 Tell me.」
SCRAPPER #142:「A contender.」
Thor:「A what?」
GRANDMASTER:「I need to go closer. I want a closer look at this. Can you take us closer? Thank you.」
narrator:Grandmaster advances on Thor.
 Examining him closely and strangely. Then:
GRANDMASTER:「Pay this lady.」
Thor:「Just wait a damn minute.
 I'm not for sale.」

narrator:Topaz transfers S142 the units. Without sympathy or ceremony, S142 exits.
Thor:「You'll pay for this!」
SCRAPPER #142:「No, I got paid for this.」
narrator:Thor claws at the obedience disk, trying to RIP IT OUT.
 He gets some separation from his skin, but the disk is causing him even more pain. Thor eventually has to let go. Grandmaster holds up HIS OWN fob device and uses it like a wand to guide Thor's HOVER CHAIR, which follows Grandmaster around as he speaks.
GRANDMASTER:「Here's what I wanna know.
 Who are you?」
Thor:「I am the God of THUNDER!!!」

Thor:「Hi.」
narrator:Carlo only further weeps.
GRANDMASTER:「So...」
narrator:COUSIN CARLO Please.
 I'm sorry.
GRANDMASTER:「Carlo... I pardon you.」
narrator:COUSIN CARLO Thank you.

GRANDMASTER:「I'm stepping in it. I'm stepping in it. Look out!」
Thor:「repulsed) Oh, the smell.」

narrator:Grandmaster and Thor arrive at a space where A GROUP OF MUSICIANS PLAY STRANGE INSTRUMENTS (the source of the music thus far). Grandmaster joins them, still speaking to Thor.
 Grandmaster begins PLAYING a strange piano-like contraption, riffing a melody over the existing music.
GRANDMASTER:「My name is Grandmaster. I preside over a little harlequinade called the Contest of Champions. People come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it. And you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast. What do you say to that?」
Thor:「We're not friends, and I don't give a shit about your games! I'm going back to Asgard!」
GRANDMASTER:「amused) Ass-gard? (then:) One, two, three, four.」
narrator:Grandmaster really gets into his PLAYING. Grandmaster's guards and VIP guests start MOVING TO THE MUSIC.
 Thor takes a moment to look around at this bizarre spectacle unfolding around him. In doing so, he zeroes in on one particular group of VIPS, specifically...
 LOKI! He's lounging and dressed in Sakaarian garb.
LOKI:「There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me. At that moment, I let go.」
Thor:「Loki!? Loki! Over here!」

narrator:Loki notices Thor. Blanches a little. Sidles closer so as to speak to Thor without looking like he's speaking to Thor.
LOKI:「Excuse me one second.」
Thor:「Loki! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

narrator:Loki hustles over to Thor, SHUSHING him.
LOKI:「What?
 You're alive?」
Thor:「Yes, of course I'm alive.」
LOKI:「What are you doing here?」
Thor:「What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm stuck in this stupid chair. Where's your chair?」
LOKI:「I didn't get a chair.」
Thor:「Get me out of this one.」
LOKI:「I can't.」
Thor:「What?」
LOKI:「I've made friends with this man. He's called the Grandmaster.」
Thor:「Oh, he's crazy!」
LOKI:「I've gained his favor.. The Bi- Frost brought me out here weeks ago.」
Thor:「Weeks ago?
 I just got here.」
narrator:Suddenly Grandmaster is right next to them.
GRANDMASTER:「What are you whispering about?」
narrator:Both Thor and Loki react, startled.
GRANDMASTER:「Time works real different around these parts. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

 On any other world, I'd be like, millions of years old. But here on Sakaar...」

narrator:Grandmaster beholds himself.
 Then turns to Loki.
 A truly uncomfortable silence.
GRANDMASTER:「In any case, you know this... You call yourself Lord of Thunder?」
Thor:「God of Thunder.
 Tell him.」
LOKI:「I've never met this man in my life.」
Thor:「He's my brother.」
LOKI:「Adopted.」
GRANDMASTER:「Is he any kind of a fighter?」
narrator:Loki shrugs, gives the universal gesture for "so-so."
Thor:「You take this thing out of my neck and I'll show you.」
GRANDMASTER:「Now listen to that. He's threatening me. Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal. If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg...」
Thor:「Asgard.」
GRANDMASTER:「Any contender who defeats my champion, their freedom they shall win.」
Thor:「Fine. Then point me in the direction of whoever's ass I have to kick.」

Thor:「Loki!」
narrator:Guards arrive.
 They haul Thor up and escort him out.

 INT. THE ARENA - GLADIATOR CELLS - NIGHT

 Thor is shoved into a spacious cell where other alien prisoners are lurking in the back.
 The thick cell door SLAMS SHUT behind Thor. Thor gets up and immediately begins THROWING his shoulder into the door. The door doesn't budge, not even a little.
 Behind him, KORG, a hulking Kronan rock alien, speaks up.
KORG:「Hey! Take it easy man! (Thor looks back) Over here. The pile of rocks waving at you. Yeah I'm actually a thing, I'm a being. Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here. I'm made of rocks, as you can see, but don't let that intimidate you. You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors. (GIGGLES to himself) Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you. This is my very good friend over here, Miek. He's an insect and has knives for hands.」
narrator:MIEK, a slug alien inside a robot exoskeleton, says hello by doing some karate moves.
Thor:「You're a Kronan, aren't you?」

KORG:「That I am.」
Thor:「How'd you end up in here?」
KORG:「Well, I tried to start a revolution but didn't print enough pamphlets, so hardly anyone turned up. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16
 41.
 Except for my mom and her boyfriiend, who I hate. As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator. Bit of a promotional disaster. (secretive) But I'm actually organizing another revolution. I don't know if you'd be interested in something like that. Do you reckon you'd be interested?」
narrator:Thor tries to run ahead down the circle and loops back around behind Korg.
Thor:「How did you...」
KORG:「Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle. But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle.」
Thor:「This doesn't make any sense.」
KORG:「No, nothing makes sense here. The only thing that does make sense, is that nothing makes sense.」
Thor:「Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster's Champion?」
KORG:「Doug has. Doug! (realizes) Oh, right, Doug's dead. That's right. Everyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perishes.」

Thor:「What about you? You're made of rocks.」

Thor:「Yes I am. Fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place.」

LOKI:「Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position with Grandmaster, it took me time to win his trust. He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.」
narrator:Thor throws another stone through Loki.
 Disinterested.
LOKI:「What I'm telling you is, you could join me at the Grandmaster's side. Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...」
narrator:Loki gestures: "we take over."
 Thor throws another stone through Loki.
 Bored.
LOKI:「You're not seriously thinking of going back, are you? Our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass. She's stronger than both of us. She's stronger than you. You don't stand a chance. Do you understand what I'm saying to you?」
narrator:Thor just scowls.
LOKI:「Fine. I guess I'll just have to go it alone. Like I've always done. (Thor smirks) Would you say something?」
narrator:Now out of stones, Thor looks around the floor for more.
LOKI:「Say something!」
narrator:Thor finally looks right at Loki, speaks fast and curt:
Thor:「What would you like me to say? You faked your own death, you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power, stranded him on Earth... (on Loki:) -to die, releasing the Goddess of Death. (back to Thor:) (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

 Thor, Korg, and a gaggle of other prisoners/fighters have been led from their cells to a PRE-FIGHT HOLDING AREA.
 Korg and Thor are by the weapons rack.
KORG:「Yuck! There's Still someone's hair and blood all over this. Guys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight? Disgusting slobs. (then:) Thor...wanna use a big wooden fork?」
Thor:「No.」
KORG:「Yeah, not really useful unless you're fighting off three vampires that were huddled together.」
Thor:「I really wish I had my hammer.」

Thor:「Quite unique. It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star. And when I spun it really, really fast it gave me the ability to fly.」
KORG:「You rode a hammer?」
Thor:「No, I didn't ride the hammer.」
KORG:「The hammer rode you on your back?」
Thor:「No. I used to spin it really fast, and it would pull me off the...」
KORG:「Oh my God.
 The hammer pulled you off?」
Thor:「The ground. It would pull me off the ground, up into the air, and I would fly. Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me.」
KORG:「Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship wiht this hammer and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.」
Thor:「That's a nice way of putting it.」
narrator:Thor spots S142 dealing at the bar.
 He's once again eyeing the fob device clipped to her belt.
 Scowls.
SCRAPPER #142:「I said they're mine.」
Thor:「See her, the one that put me in here.」

KORG:「Yeah, Scrapper 142. She's strong. And she drinks a lot. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

 Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man. They are hard to perish.」
Thor:「Asgardian?」
narrator:Thor breaks away from the line and runs to S142.
Thor:「Hey!
 Hey!」
narrator:S142 holds up the fob.
Thor:「Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk. Asgard is in danger.」
narrator:Thor then notices a series of PATTERNED SCARS, or BRANDS, on her forearms. It's a moment of recognition and disbelief.
Thor:「My God, you're a Valkyrie. I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger...until I found out that you were all women. There's nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women. Sometimes a little too much. Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation. I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors. It's about time.」
SCRAPPER #142:「Are you done?」
narrator:WARDEN (O.S.) Lord of Thunder, you're up.
Thor:「Please, help me.
 I need your help.」

SCRAPPER #142:「Bye.」
Thor:「Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward because the Valkyrie are sworn to protect the throne.」

 Thor is strapped to a chair. Reveal a weird alien BARBER (Stan Lee cameo) holding up some rusty shears.
 STAN LEE Now, don't you move. My hands ain't as steady as they used to be.
Thor:「By Odin's beard, you shall not cut my hair... lest you feel the wrath of the might Thor.」
narrator:Barber activates a menacing CUTTING TOOL.
 Thor freaks out.
Thor:「Please. Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair! No!」

narrator:The entire crowd is on its feet. Palpable anticipation.
 The spotlights change to bright stadium lights.
GRANDMASTER:「He's undefeated. HE'S THE REIGNING...HE'S THE DEFENDING... Ladies and gentlemen... I give you...」
narrator:KA-BOOM!
 EXPLODING through a door is the Champion...
 THE INCREDIBLE HULK! He wears an armored shoulder guard and a Spartan helmet. He carries a warhammer in one hand and a battleaxe in the other. Hulk POUNDS his chest and ROARS, further energizing an already frenzied crowd.
 Meanwhile, the sight of Hulk makes Thor's arms drop to his sides along with his jaw dropping to the ground. And then-
 Thor LAUGHS his ass off. Like, "that's my buddy over there!"
Thor:「Yes!」
narrator:IN THE VIP BOX: Loki goes ghost white. Traumatic memories of being Hulk-smashed flood his brain. Gone is all his joy.
LOKI:「I have to get off this planet.」
narrator:Loki tries to exit, but the Grandmaster stops him.
GRANDMASTER:「Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going?」
narrator:Grandmaster plops Loki down in the front row, right against the glass. Loki casually tries to hide his face in his hand.
 IN THE ARENA:

Thor:「Hey! We know each other. He's a friend from work. (to Hulk:) Where have you been? Everybody thought you were dead. So much has happened since I last saw you. I lost my hammer. Like, yesterday, so that's still pretty fresh. (then:) Loki! Loki's alive. Can you believe it? He's up there. (waves to Loki:) Loki! Look who it is! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

narrator:Loki is petrified.
Thor:「Banner, I never thought I would say this, but I'm happy to see you.」
narrator:IN THE ARENA: Hulk is still eyeballing Thor while the capacity crowd CHANTS insanely for "HULK! HULK! HULK!"
Thor:「Banner.
 Hey, Banner!」
narrator:Hulk's face grimaces and contorts, suppressing puny Banner.
HULK:「NO BANNER!
 ONLY HULK!」
narrator:Hulk CHARGES at Thor.
 Insanely fast.
Thor:「What are you doing?
 It's me.」
narrator:Thor DODGES the first few attacks, but then Hulk SHATTERS his shield and sends Thor FLYING.
 Thor draws a sword and STABS it into the ground to slow his momentum. Draws the other sword and faces off against Hulk.
Thor:「Banner, we're friends. This is crazy. I don't want to hurt you!」

narrator:Thor advances on Hulk with all the swagger. He takes off his helmet and CALLS OUT to Hulk, provoking him.
Thor:「Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low.」
narrator:Hulk takes off his helmet.
 Scowling.
 Teeth GRINDING.
Thor:「That's it. The sun's going down. I won't hurt you anymore. No one will.」
narrator:WHOOSH! Thor is suddenly dragged out of frame. Hulk has Thor by the leg and is WHIPPING him against the arena floor. Over and over and over again.
 IN THE VIP BOX: Loki's whole mood shifts. The joy returns to his face, like "everything will be alright!" Loki LAUGHS.
LOKI:「Yes! That's how it feels! (to Grandmaster:) I'm just a huge fan of the sport.」
narrator:Thor is SMASHED into the floor face first.
 Hulk ROARS and RUSHES Thor with his axe.
Thor:「All right. Screw it.」
narrator:CLANG! The giant weapons CLASH! Now Thor and Hulk are fighting warhammer versus battleaxe...
 and Thor is winning! He's getting the better of these exchanges, using Hulk's aggression against him. Thor continually KNOCKS and/or TRIPS Hulk off his feet while evading all of Hulk's best attacks.

Thor:「I know you're in there, Banner. I'll get you out!」
narrator:One particular vicious blow DISARMS Hulk, and Thor BREAKS Hulk's axe with the warhammer. Thor then BASHES Hulk in the chest, KNOCKING him to the ground.
Thor:「What's the matter with you? You're embarrassing me! I told them we were friends! BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

narrator:Thor starts to get up, but then winces.
 He moves slowly.
 He's in a GIANT ROOM with stark graphic patterns on the walls. With a few achy grimaces, Thor stands up and wanders around. There's furniture, large cushions, and a sleeping area enclosed by the SKULL of a giant beast.
 NOISE behind him.
 Thor follows the noise to find-
 Hulk having eased himself into a large steaming JACUZZI. Thor looks at him quizzically. Hulk isn't angry. He's RELAXED, but he's not turning into Banner.
Thor:「Are we cool?」
narrator:Hulk grunts.
 I guess so.
Thor:「It's Hulk in a hot tub. (then:) How long have you been like that?」
HULK:「Like what?」
Thor:「Like this.
 Big, green, ...stupid.」
HULK:「Hulk always Hulk.」

narrator:Thor takes this in, and then walks over to a window that looks out across the city. Does some spatial math, realizes: Thor looks back out the window.
 He sees a ramshackle SPACESHIP taking off and ROCKETING skyward. Higher and higher, it's going for a wormhole when-
 BOOM! One of Grandmaster's Palace Patrol ships, more modern and heavy duty, BLOWS it out of the sky.
 On Thor, wheels turning.
 He turns to Hulk.
Thor:「How'd you get here?」
HULK:「Winning.」
Thor:「You mean cheating? (re: Obedience Disk) (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

 Were they wearing one of these when you won? How'd you arrive here?」
HULK:「Quinjet.」
narrator:Hulk mimes a plane landing in the water.
Thor:「Yes.
 Where is the Quinjet now?」
narrator:Hulk stands up, and exits the hot tub, naked.
Thor:「That's naked. He's very naked. It's in my brain now.」
narrator:Hulk points out the window.
HULK:「Quinjet.」
narrator:Thor sees the Quinjet in a massive alien junkyard.

Thor:「Yes! I'm getting us out of here. This is a terrible, awful place. You're gonna love Asgard. It's big. It's golden. Shiny.」
narrator:Hulk sits on his bed, eating a pumpkin.
HULK:「Hulk stay.」
Thor:「No, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard. We must prevent Ragnarok.」
HULK:「Rag-na-ruh?」
Thor:「The prophesied death of my home world, the end of days, it's the end of- (Hulk's blank stare) If you help me get back to Asgard, I can help you get back to Earth.」

Thor:「Earth loves Hulk. They love you. You're of the Avengers. One of the team, one of our friends. This is what friends do. They support each other.」
HULK:「You're Banner's friend.」
Thor:「I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.」
HULK:「Banner's friend.」
Thor:「I don't even like Banner. (bad impersonation) "I'm into numbers and science and stuff."」
HULK:「Thor go. Hulk Stay.」
Thor:「Fine. Stay here. Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way. The red, the white. Just pick a color.」
narrator:Thor heads for the exit, a wide open door.
HULK:「Smash you.」
Thor:「You didn't smash anything. I won that fight」
HULK:「I smashed you.」
Thor:「Yeah, sure, sure.」
HULK:「Baby Arms.」
Thor:「What?」

Thor:「Moron!
 You big child.」
narrator:Thor heads to the open entrance.
 Hulk smiles, anticipating.
HULK:「Thor go!」
Thor:「I am going.」
narrator:ZAP! Thor's jolted back by the obedience disk.
 There are perimeter sensors in the doorway.
 Hulk CHUCKLES at Thor as he hits the floor.
 Points.
HULK:「Thor go again! (then:) Thor home.」
narrator:TIME CUT:
 Thor slumps against the wall, head sagging.
 Hulk grabs his giant battleaxe.
 He's armored up.
HULK:「Hulk trains.」
Thor:「That's great. Have fun.」
narrator:Hulk exits. Thor watches him go. Then, at the end of the hallway Hulk meets up with Valkyrie! They begin play- fighting, a clearly friendly rapport.
 Thor can't believe it. He runs to the entrance, but by the time he reaches the perimeter sensors they are gone.
 Thor sighs. Walks over to the window. Looks up through a wormhole, stars twinkling on the other end of it.
Thor:「A57
 Heimdall, I know you can see me.

narrator:Thor continues his plea at the window.
Thor:「I need you to help me. Help me see.」

 Thor suddenly finds himself in Asgard. Disoriented at first, Thor turns to see Heimdall hiding in the shadows.
 Heimdall harshly SHUSHES Thor and gestures for him to get up against the wall. Thor complies. Sees the refugees.
 After a beat a roving patrol of Hela's Butchers creep by through the street. They don't spot our heroes. Pause.
 Heimdall turns to Thor, speaks only in hushed whispers.
HEIMDALL:「I see you. But you are far away.」
Thor:「What's going on here?」
HEIMDALL:「Come see for yourself.」
narrator:Without warning, Heimdall leads the family out of the alley and DASHES down the street. Thor follows...
 but then stops. Looks around to see THE OCCUPIED CITY OF ASGARD, emitting a smoky aura of chaos. A chilling sight.
 Down the street, Heimdall gestures for the family to slow down. He sees something. Ushers them into an alcove.
 Thor joins them just in time to avoid being seen by another roving patrol of Hela's Butchers. Heimdall again motions for Thor to "shh" until the threat has passed. Then:

HEIMDALL:「I'm providing refuge in a stronghold build by our ancestors. But if the garrison falls our only escape will is Bi-Frost.」
Thor:「You're talking about evacuating Asgard?」

HEIMDALL:「O.S.) She draws her power from Asgard and grows stronger everyday.」
narrator:Back to Thor and Heimdall.
HEIMDALL:「Come on.」
narrator:As Heimdall quickly leads refugees down a safe pathway:
HEIMDALL:「V.O.) Hela is ravenous. If I let her leave, she'll consume the Nine Realms and all the cosmos.」
narrator:Turns back to Thor, approaches him.
HEIMDALL:「We need you.」
Thor:「I'm working on it, but I don't even really know where the hell I am.」
narrator:Two packs of Butchers arrive simultaneously.
 Spot Heimdall.
HEIMDALL:「You're on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go through one.」
Thor:「Which one?」

 Hulk steps up to Thor, looking inquisitively down at him.
HULK:「Thor sad.」
Thor:「Shut up.」
narrator:Hulk HITS Thor, bullying him into opening up.
HULK:「THOR SAD!!!」
narrator:Thor hops up, YELLS in Hulk's face.
 Paces around.
Thor:「I'm not sad, you idiot. I'm pissed off! Angry. I lost my father. I lost my hammer.」
narrator:THUD! THUD! He turns to see Hulk punching his pillow.
 Hulk stops. Stares.
HULK:「Whining and crying.
 Cry like baby.」
Thor:「You're not even listening.」
narrator:Thor KICKS a random helmet.
HULK:「Don't kick stuff.」
Thor:「You're being a really bad friend.」
HULK:「You bad friend!」
Thor:「You know what we call you?」
HULK:「No.」

Thor:「We call you the stupid Avenger. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

HULK:「You're tiny Avenger!」
narrator:Hulk throws a shield that nearly decapitates Thor.
Thor:「What, are you crazy?」
HULK:「Yes.」
Thor:「You know what? Earth does hate you.」
narrator:Hulk gets sad.
 Wanders over to his bed to mope.
 Thor realizes he went to far.
 Joins Hulk on the bed.
HULK:「No.」
Thor:「I'm sorry I said those things. You're not the stupid Avenger. Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.」
HULK:「It's okay.」
Thor:「You just can't go around throwing shields at people. Could have killed me.」
HULK:「I know. I'm sorry.
 I just get so angry all the time.
 Hulk always, always angry.」
Thor:「I know. We're the same, you and I. We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.」
HULK:「Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water.」
Thor:「We're kind of both like fire. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

 We follow Two Palace Guards as they enter Hulk's Suite.
 Hulk is throwing a LARGE BALL against the far wall. It's so hard it makes dents in the wall. Hulk stops and turns.
 Reveal that the guards are escorting Valkyrie. They leave... Valkyrie and Hulk face off.
HULK:「Angry girl!」
narrator:Val bounds forward and gives The Incredible Hulk a big hug. Hulk laughs and then begins playfully roughhousing with Val.
VALKYRIE:「What's going on? What do you...?」
narrator:Hulk steps away, allowing Valkyrie to see Thor. Her smile disappears. She stares at Hulk, so annoyed. Hulk mopes a little. Like, "I done bad." Turns back to Thor:
VALKYRIE:「You're so thick-headed that you can't tell when someone's hiding all the way across the universe and wants to be left alone?」
Thor:「We need to talk.」
VALKYRIE:「No, you want to talk to me.」

narrator:Valkyrie turns to leave.
Thor:「to Hulk:) I need her to stay.」

narrator:Val shoots an annoyed sneer at Hulk.
 Hulk SNORTS back.
HULK:「Stay!
 Please?」
narrator:Valkyrie looks him up and down. Obedience Disks to the max.
 Hulk begins BOUNCING his ball against the wall again.
 Valkyrie walks over to Hulk's bar, picks up an UNOPENED BOTTLE of liquor. Hulk snorts, disapprovingly. Val puts it down and finds something cheaper, she pops the cork.
VALKYRIE:「All right. Here's the deal. I'll listen to you till this is empty.」
narrator:She TIPS BACK the bottle and starts CHUGGING.
Thor:「Asgard is in danger and people are dying. We need to get back there. I need your help...wow.」
VALKYRIE:「Finished. Bye.」
narrator:She has indeed finished. She goes to leave.
Thor:「Odin is dead.」
narrator:Valkyrie stops short (the BALL BANGING noise continues). Her silence speaks volumes. Thor has a realization.
Thor:「Hela, the Goddess of Death has invaded Asgard.」
VALKYRIE:「If Hela's back then Asgard is already lost.」
Thor:「I'm going to stop her.」

VALKYRIE:「Alone?」
Thor:「Nope. I'm putting together a team. It's me, you, and the big guy. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

HULK:「No team.
 Only Hulk.」
Thor:「It's me and you.」
VALKYRIE:「I think it's only you.」
Thor:「Wait. Just listen. The Valkyrie are legend, elite warriors of Asgard. You are sworn to defend the throne.」
VALKYRIE:「I'm not getting dragged into another one of Odin's family squabbles.」
Thor:「What's that supposed to mean?」
VALKYRIE:「Your sister. Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.」
narrator:Hulk's ball rolls into frame. An off screen GRUNT.
 Val picks it up and tosses it back to Hulk.
VALKYRIE:「When it grew beyond Odin's control, she massacred everyone in the palace and tried to seize the throne. When she tried to escape her banishment, he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back. I only survived because... (trails off, brooding) Look, I already faced her once back when I believed in the throne, and it cost me everything. THAT'S what's wrong with Asgard. The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.」
narrator:Pause. Thor moves towards Valkyrie, goes to put a comforting hand on her shoulder.
Thor:「I agree.」

VALKYRIE:「Don't get familiar.」
Thor:「I agree. That's why I turned down the throne. But this isn't about the crown. This is about the people. They're dying and they're you're people, too.」
narrator:Val SHOVES him away.
 Thor stumbles back.
VALKYRIE:「Forget it.
 I have.」
Thor:「nods, understanding) Okay.」
VALKYRIE:「Okay.」
Thor:「Good. Great.」
VALKYRIE:「Great.」
Thor:「Thank you.」
VALKYRIE:「For what?」
Thor:「For this.」
narrator:Reveal that Thor has lifted the fob device off Val's belt!
Thor:「Didn't see that did you?」
narrator:Thor presses the button and ALL THE OBEDIENCE DISKS EMBEDDED IN HIS NECK AND BELT POWER DOWN! Confident smirk.

 Hulk does.
Thor:「I choose to run toward my problems and not away from them. Because that's what...」
narrator:Thor HURLS IT at the MAIN WINDOW - It bounces off, hitting Thor in the face. He stands, facing Valkyrie.
Thor:「Because that's what heroes do.」

Thor:「All right.

 A distant, confused stare.
BANNER:「I did?」
Thor:「Yeah. Quite a lot's happened. You and I had a fight recently.」
BANNER:「Did I win?」
Thor:「No, I won. Easily.」
BANNER:「Doesn't sound right.」
Thor:「Well, it's true.」

Thor:「Seductive GOD of Thunder.
 We need to move.」
BANNER:「Oh, no. This is bad. This is really, really bad. Thor, I think I'm freaking out.」
Thor:「No, no, no. Don't freak out. You're okay. Put these on.」
narrator:Thor tosses Banner some clothes.
 Banner looks at them.
BANNER:「These are Tony's clothes.」
Thor:「I know, come on.」
BANNER:「Is he here?」
Thor:「No, he's not here. But listen. Just stay calm, okay? The sun's going down. The sun's getting really low. Sun's going down.」

 BANNER sits, groaning, head in his hands. THOR is beside him, rubbing his back and on the lookout for threats.
Thor:「The sun's going down. It's getting really low. The sun's going down. It's getting real low.」
BANNER:「Would you stop saying that!?」
Thor:「I just need you to stay calm.」
BANNER:「Calm!?
 I'm on an alien planet!」
Thor:「It's just a planet.
 You've been on a planet before.」
BANNER:「Yeah!
 One!」
Thor:「Now you've been on two. That's a good thing. It's a new experience.」
BANNER:「My neurons, they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

 The whole thing is totally different this time. (beat) In the past, I always felt like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel, but this time it's like he had the keys and I was locked in the trunk.」
Thor:「Alright, well, you're back now, that's all that matters.」

BANNER:「No, it's not what matters. What I'm trying to tell you, is that if I turn into the Hulk again, Banner may never come back. And we're stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out.」
Thor:「We're not stranded, I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home.」
BANNER:「Thank you.」
Thor:「Not your home, though.
 Asgard.」
BANNER:「What?」
Thor:「Listen, my people are in great danger. You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being who also happens to be my sister.」
BANNER:「Okay, that is so wrong on so many... I don't wanna fight your sister. That's a family issue.」
Thor:「No, she's an evil being.」
BANNER:「I don't care what she is.
 I'm not fighting any more beings.
 I'm sick of it. I just told you. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

 If I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again. And you don't care.」
Thor:「No, no. I'm putting together the team. The Hulk is the fire.」
BANNER:「Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk.」

Thor:「What?
 No!」
BANNER:「It's gross. You don't care about me. You're not my friend.」
Thor:「No! I don't even like the Hulk. He's all like... "smash, smash, smash." I prefer you.」
BANNER:「Thanks.」
Thor:「But if I'm being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings, he is very powerful and useful.」
BANNER:「Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.」
Thor:「Is he though?」
BANNER:「How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero. How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.」
Thor:「Fine, you don't have to fight anyone. But we're in danger here, so we have to move.」

Thor:「I need a disguise.
 I'm a fugitive.」
BANNER:「I need a disguise.」
Thor:「You are the disguise.」
narrator:Banner finds a pair of Stark's sunglasses in his jacket.
BANNER:「I'll be Tony Stark.」
Thor:「What?」
BANNER:「Yeah.
 Tony and the gypsy.」
Thor:「No, no you're not Tony.
 You're Bruce Banner.」
BANNER:「Then why did you dress me up like Tony?」
Thor:「Because you were naked.」
BANNER:「Okay, I'll give you that.」
narrator:They stand up. Banner adjusts his crotch.
Thor:「What are you doing?
 Stop doing that!」
BANNER:「Tony wears his pants super tight!」
Thor:「Why are you being so weird?」

Thor:「Hey. It's okay. You're good. Calm down. Come on. Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard and you're not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again. All right?」

 EXT. PARADE OF VICTORS - CONTINUOUS

 It's a massive street festival where revelers dance and cheer while throwing powdered paint at each other... in celebration of Hulk! Green EVERYWHERE!
 Inside the parade it is total chaos. Thor searches for Banner as he's PELTED with green powder. Pandemonium. In the crowd Thor sees a pack of SCRAPPERS on the hunt for the reward.
 Thor spots Banner. He surges forward, GRABS Banner, and pulls him into another alley, but sees-
 Valkyrie is approaching from down the alley!
Thor:「This is bad. Banner!
 Banner!」
narrator:Thor pulls Banner back into the crowd. Thor briefly turns to see that he is no longer holding Banner's - it's the arm of a SMALL ALIEN who squeals in fright.
 Thor sees Banner across the crowd.
 Thor MUSCLES his way through the madness, knocking rowdy fans aside. He reaches Banner and holds him protectively, awkwardly trying to rub his shoulders.
 One of the aliens Thor knocked aside turns out to be a MASSIVE SCRAPPER. He rears up, turning on Thor and Banner.
 WHAM! From out of nowhere, Valkyrie CLOCKS this Scrapper with a brass knuckle right cross. The Scrapper DROPS.
 Thor looks at Val while clutching Banner like a child.

Thor:「Hi. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

VALKYRIE:「Hi.」
Thor:「I was gonna do that.」
VALKYRIE:「Yeah, well, I did it first.」
Thor:「That's good. What are you doing here?」
VALKYRIE:「What are you doing here?
 I thought you were leaving.」
Thor:「I got sidetracked.」
VALKYRIE:「What's with the...」
Thor:「It's my disguise.」
VALKYRIE:「But I can see your face.」

VALKYRIE:「Look, I've spent years in a haze trying to forget my past. Sakaaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day.」
Thor:「I was thinking that you drink too much, and that probably was going to kill you.」
VALKYRIE:「I don't plan to stop drinking, but I don't want to forget. I can't turn away anymore. So, if I'm donna to die, well... it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag.」
Thor:「Good.」
narrator:They arrive at a door.
 Before they enter:
VALKYRIE:「Yeah. So I'm saying that I wanna be on the team. Has it got a name?」
Thor:「Yeah, it's called the Revengers. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

VALKYRIE:「Revengers?」

 Valkyrie opens the front door, revealing-
 Loki! He is as restrained as anyone could be, sitting in the middle of the apartment with a dozen chains around him.
 LOKIE Surprise.
 Thor TOSSES a bottle.
 It BOUNCES off of Loki's head.
LOKI:「OW!」
Thor:「Just had to be sure.」

narrator:Val lays something on the bed. Unwraps it to reveal AN OLD ASGARDIAN SWORD. Thor's eyes go wide as she sharpens it.
Thor:「Is that... a Dragonfang?」
VALKYRIE:「It is.」
Thor:「My God. This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.」
VALKYRIE:「Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems. Our best bet is a wormhole just outside the city limits.」
narrator:A nice clean wormhole outside the city.
VALKYRIE:「Refuel on Xandar and be back in Asgard in around 18 months.」
Thor:「Nope. We're going through that one.」
narrator:Thor points at the nightmare tornado wormhole over the ocean.
VALKYRIE:「The Devil's Anus?」
BANNER:「Wait, whose anus are we going through?」
Thor:「For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it.」
BANNER:「That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of an Einstein- Rosen Bridge.」
VALKYRIE:「We need another ship.
 That would tear mine to pieces.」

Thor:「She's right. We need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

narrator:Banner gives Thor a quizzical look.
BANNER:「And has an offline power steering system that could also function without the on-board computer.」
VALKYRIE:「And we need one with cup holders, because we're gonna die. So, drinks!」
BANNER:「Do I know you? I feel like I know you.」
VALKYRIE:「I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.」
Thor:「to Banner:) What do you say, doctor? Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway. Talk about an adventure.」
narrator:Thor and Banner high five as Val stares at them blankly.
 BANNER
 THOR We need a ship.
 Need a ship.
VALKYRIE:「There are one or two ships, absolute top-of-the-line models--」
LOKI:「I don't mean to impose, but the Grandmaster has a great many ships. I may eve have stolen the access codes to his security system.」
narrator:All eyes turn to Loki. Valkyrie throws her bottle at him. It smashes above his head.
VALKYRIE:「And suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing.」

LOKI:「Heavens, no. I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster. (MORE) BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

 And in exchange for codes and access to a ship I'm asking for safe passage...through the anus.」
Thor:「You're telling us you can get us access into the garage without setting off any alarms?」
LOKI:「Yes, brother. I can.」
BANNER:「Okay, can I just... A quick FYI, I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago and he was totally ready to kill any of us.」
VALKYRIE:「He did try to kill me.」
Thor:「Yes, me too. On many, many occasions. There was one time when we were children, he transformed himself into a snake, and he knows that I love snakes. So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it and he transformed back into himself and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!" And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.」
narrator:Loki suppresses a smile.
VALKYRIE:「If we're boosting a ship, we're gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.」
LOKI:「Why not set the beast loose?」
Thor:「Shut up.」

VALKYRIE:「You guys have a beast?」
Thor:「No, there's no beast. He's just being stupid. We're going to start a revolution. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

narrator:Thor and Loki heft up two Sakaarian guns.
Thor:「Hello!」
LOKI:「Hi!」
narrator:Thor and Loki BLAST all the guards, moving to another door.
LOKI:「Odin brought us together, it's almost poetic that his death should split us apart. We might as well be strangers now. "Two sons of the crown" set adrift.」

Thor:「This place is perfect for you. It's savage, chaotic, lawless. Brother, you're going to do GREAT here.」
LOKI:「Do you truly think so little of me?」

 Masks his feelings with:
LOKI:「It's probably for the best that we never see one another again.」

 Thor pats Loki affectionately on the shoulder.
 Hold on Loki. Did Thor just get through to him?

Thor:「That's what you always wanted.」

narrator:A small group of Sakaarian guards turn toward Thor and Loki. One guard aims his gun at them.
Thor:「Get help! Help him!」
narrator:Thor picked up Loki and flings him at the guards, knocking them down like bowling pins. Loki stands up and Thor steps to Loki's side.
Thor:「Classic.」
LOKI:「I still hate it. It's humiliating.」
Thor:「Not for me, it's not.
 Which one's the ship she told us to get?」

Thor:「I agree.」
narrator:BZZZT! Thor ZAPS Loki and HOLDS DOWN the button. Loki HITS the ground, WRITHING in pain. Thor approaches. Pause.
Thor:「Oh brother, you're becoming predictable. I trust you, you betray me. Round and round in circles we go.」
narrator:Thor continues to "think about it" for a beat while Loki convulses in agony on the floor. Finally, Thor kneels down:
Thor:「See, Loki, life is about, it's about growth. It's about change. But you seem to just wanna stay the same. I guess what I'm trying to say is that you'll always be the God of Mischief, but you could be more. I'll just put this over here for you. BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

VALKYRIE:「mixed emotions) I never thought I'd be back here.」
narrator:The ship descends into the clouds above Asgard.
BANNER:「I thought it'd be nicer. I mean, not that it's not nice. It's just, it's on fire.」
narrator:THE SHIP CLEARS THE CLOUDS TO REVEAL-

VALKYRIE:「Here, up here in the mountains.」
narrator:A projected map on the console shows the mountain where the stronghold is located. There is a red dot in the mountain, indicating where the Asgardian citizens are.
VALKYRIE:「Heat signatures. People clustered together. Hela's coming for them.」
Thor:「Okay, drop me off at the palace and I'll draw her away.」

VALKYRIE:「And get yourself killed?」

 Hela arriving at the far side of bridge.
 She is seething with power, a vision of death.

 Hela walks towards them.
 Menacing and deliberate.
 Thor, Loki, and Val step forward to protect the Asgardians. They huddle together.
Thor:「I think we should disband the Revengers.」
LOKI:「Hit her with a lightning blast.」
Thor:「I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning. It did nothing.」

Thor:「It won't end there. The longer Hela's on Asgard the more powerful she grows. She'll hunt us down. We need to stop her here and now.」
VALKYRIE:「What's our move?」
LOKI:「I'm not doing "Get help."」
narrator:Thor sees Hela approaching. He sees the palace behind her. He comes to a realization.
Thor:「Asgard's not a place, it's a people. (then) This was never about stopping Ragnarok...it was about causing Ragnarok. (to Loki:) Go to the vault. Surtur's crown. It's the only way.」

 Hela's attention is on Surtur as the palace COLLAPSES around him. So she is unprepared for-
 SHLNK! Mustering up all her remaining strength, Val DRIVES Dragonfang through Hela's chest, effectively PINNING her to the bridge.
 Refocused on Val, Hela goes to deliver a death blow when-
 Thor BOLTS forward!
 He PULLS Val from Hela's clutches.
 Thor turns and FIRES LIGHTNING INTO DRAGONFANG, which DISLODGES the section of the bridge that Hela is pinned to!
 The ground beneath Hela BREAKS FREE and she goes FALLING down into the expanding fissure in Asgard's bedrock.
 Badly injured, Thor and Valkyrie look up to see-
 Surtur INCREASING in size, now towering over the palace.
SURTUR:「Tremble before me Asgard, for I am your reckoning!」

 Thor steps out onto the main deck to see an assembly of both Asgardian and Sakaarian refugees awaiting their King.
 Thor looks over his people and begins to walk through the crowd. His subjects part, allowing him through.
 It is the antithesis of the opening coronation from the first THOR movie. The people aren't cheering and lauding him, but rather they are smiling. Humbly bowing. Grateful.
 And Thor isn't acting arrogant. Not trying to show off any swagger. He is stately. A contemplative and dignified king.
 At the end of the procession, Hulk, Loki, Valkyrie, and Heimdall stand next to the CAPTAIN'S CHAIR.
VALKYRIE:「Your throne.」

 Flanking him on opposite sides are Valkyrie and Heimdall. Behind/towering above them is the Hulk. Loki joins them.
