Judge Dredd:「Hershey. What is it - ?」

HERSHEY:「They're dying out-there, Dredd. A hundred and eight Judges in 48 hours. Everyone who's left is on triple shifts and pseudorphin. I thought it was organized criminals, revolutionaries, something... then I was a target.」

She glares at him - counter moves - gets an elbow against his throat! But Dredd doesn't break her hold - or turn the gun on her. It's deliberate check-mate on both their parts.」

 Hershey is on what's left of the bed. She holds a cup of coffee, more interested in its warmth than its contents. Dredd is nearby. With the borrowed helmet off, we see how haggard he looks. In the other room, Fergie putters with the wrecked computer.
 HERSHEY
 SOFTLY) Clones. Clones, from a genetic laboratory. (pause, wryly) I guess I wasn't so bad in court after all. That's why the DNA convicted you. You and Rico are...

HERSHEY:「Dredd. The Janus project didn't do that to you. You did that to yourself. He turns, startled. Realizes she's right.」
Judge Dredd:「almost in wonder) Myself. Griffin. Fargo. Even Fergie. I've been wrong about so much...」

HERSHEY:「Never the Law, Dredd. Never the Law. That means more than anything else she can say to him. He looks into her eyes. Fergie comes in, ends the moment.」
FERGIE:「You can forget the terminal out here. We're gonna have to go somewhere else to get in the System.」
Judge Dredd:「after a moment) Hershey. You just said I was never wrong about the Law. They took away my badge. I'm a convicted murderer. I have no authority any more - no legal authority. Pause. without the law as a safety net, Dredd is in uncharted emotional territory.」
