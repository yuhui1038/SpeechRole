Jan:「I 've spoken to Josh in Stamford . I 've told him the same as you and it 's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other .」
Michael Scott:「OK . No problem .」
Jan:「This does , however , mean that there is going to be downsizing .」
Michael Scott:「Me no wanna hear that , Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch . It is a real bitch . And I would n't wish that on Josh 's men . I certainly would n't wish it on my men .

Michael Scott:「Well , yeah , it is a promise . And frankly , I 'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it .」
Stanley:「It 's just that we need to know .」
Michael Scott:「I know . Hold on a second . I think Pam wanted to say something . Pam , you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then .」
Pam:「I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe .」
Man:「Are you sure about that ?」
Michael Scott:「Well , Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings .」
Dwight:「Pam , information is power .」
Stanley:「You ca n't say for sure whether it 'll be us or them , can you ?」

Michael Scott:「No , Stanley . No , you did not see me in there with her . I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere , then they 're gon na have to go through me . Right ?

Pam:「I ca n't believe this . I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you 're firing me .」

My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17 % or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee . No , no , no , no , no . It was a young Guatemalan guy . First job in the country , barely spoke English . He came to me , and said , " Mr. Scott , would you be the godfather of my child ? " Wow . Wow . Did n't work out in the end . We had to let him go . He sucked .」

Mr. Brown:「Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Great .」
Michael Scott:「Come on people , let 's get 'em in . Get in the cards ! Get in the cards !」

Mr. Brown:「Thank you . Thank you very much . OK . Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick . At Diversity Today , our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations . We believe that 99 % of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance .」
Michael Scott:「You know what ? This is a color - free - zone here . Stanley , I do n't look at you as another race .」
Mr. Brown:「Uh , see this is what I 'm talking about . We do n't have to pretend we 're color - blind .」
Michael Scott:「Exactly , were not ...」
Mr. Brown:「That 's fighting ignorance with more ignorance .」
Michael Scott:「With tolerance .」
Mr. Brown:「No . With more ignorance .」
Michael Scott:「Ignorance .」
Mr. Brown:「Right . Exactly . Uh , instead , we need to celebrate our diversity .」
Michael Scott:「Let 's celebrate .」
Mr. Brown:「Right . OK .」
Michael Scott:「Celebrate good times . Come on ! Let 's celebrate diversity . Right ?」
Mr. Brown:「Yes , exactly . Now here 's what we 're going to do . I 've noticed that ...」

Michael Scott:「You know what ? Here 's what we 're going to do . Why do n't we go around and everybody ... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually . I will go last . Go .」
Dwight:「I have two . White and Indian .」
Mr. Brown:「Actually , I 'd prefer not to start that way . Michael , I would love to have your permission to run this session . Can I have your permission ?」
Michael Scott:「Yes .」
Mr. Brown:「Thank you very much . And it would also help me if you were seated .」
Michael Scott:「OK .」
Mr. Brown:「Thank you . OK . Now , at the start of the session , I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace . Now , what I 'm going to do is choose one and we 're going to act it out .」
Dwight:「A few of the ground rules ?」
Michael Scott:「Hey , hey why do n't you run it by me and I 'll run it by him .」
Dwight:「OK , can we steer away from gay people ?」
Mr. Brown:「Um ...」

Dwight:「I 'm sorry . It 's an orientation . It 's not a race . Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays , so ... paradox .」
Mr. Brown:「Well , we only have an hour .」
Dwight:「I figured it would save time .」
Michael Scott:「OK . Why do n't we just defer to Mr ...」
Mr. Brown:「Mr. Brown .」
Michael Scott:「Ah . Oh , right ! OK . First test . I will not call you that .」
Mr. Brown:「Well , it 's my name . It 's not a test . OK ? Um , so looking through the cards , I 've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident , which is ironic , because it 's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to . Now , how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine ? Very good . OK .」
narration:[SCENE_BREAK]
Michael Scott:「How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground - breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine , same comedic timing , and people file a complaint to Corporate ? Is it because I 'm white and Chris is black ?」
narration:[SCENE_BREAK]

Mr. Brown:「So we 're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome .」
Michael Scott:「I will play the Chris Rock guy . I would like to see someone else pull this off .」
Mr. Brown:「Well , let 's have someone who was n't involved in the reenactment .」
Michael Scott:「OK , I will play guy listening .」
Mr. Brown:「Great . Guy listening . Ok , anyone else remember ?」
Kevin:「I remember .」
Mr. Brown:「Great . You 're the Chris Rock guy and you 're guy listening .」
Michael Scott:「OK .」
narration:[SCENE_BREAK]
Michael Scott:「Kevin is a great guy . He 's a great accountant . He is not much of an entertainer .」
narration:[SCENE_BREAK]
Kevin:「Basically , there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people . Every time the one type wants to have a good time , then the other type comes in and makes a real mess .」

Michael Scott:「OK . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . He 's ruin ... He 's butchering it . Could you just let me ... [ As Chris Rock ] Every time ... Every time black people want to have a good time , some ignant ass ... [ Bleep ] I take care of my kid !」
Mr. Brown:「Wait a second .」
Michael Scott:「[ Bleep ] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do !」
Mr. Brown:「Stop it !」
Michael Scott:「[ As Chris Rock ] What you want a cookie ?」

Mr. Brown:「Now , this is a simple acronym . HERO . Uh , at Diversity Today , we believe it is very easy to be a HERO . All you need are honesty , empathy , respect and open - mindedness .」
Dwight:「Excuse me , I 'm sorry , but that 's not all it takes to be a hero .」
Mr. Brown:「Oh , great . Well , what is a hero to you ?」
Dwight:「A hero kills people , people that wish him harm .」
Mr. Brown:「OK .」

Dwight:「A hero is part - human and part - supernatural . A hero is born out of a childhood trauma , or out of a disaster that must be avenged .」
Mr. Brown:「Ok , you 're thinking of a superhero .」
Dwight:「We all have a hero in our heart .」
Mr. Brown:「Now , I need you to take these forms . This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today . And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge .」
Michael Scott:「[ Clears throat ] I do n't think I can sign this .」
Mr. Brown:「I ca n't leave until you do .」
Michael Scott:「Well , OK , it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already , so ... I know , I could sign something that says that I taught something , or that I helped you teach something , so ... Pam ! Where is she ? Pam , could we change something on this ?」
Mr. Brown:「Michael , can I talk to you candidly ?」
Michael Scott:「Sure .」
narration:[SCENE_BREAK]
Mr. Brown:「We both know that I 'm here because of the comments you made .」

Michael Scott:「Here 's the thing . This office , I think this is very advanced in terms of ... racial awareness and it 's probably more advanced than you 're used to . That 's probably throwing you off a little bit .」
Mr. Brown:「Um , it 's not throwing me . I need your signature .」
Michael Scott:「OK , well I know . You told me that several times .」
Mr. Brown:「Yes , but you 're not listening to me . Yours is the only signature I need .」
Michael Scott:「OK .」
Mr. Brown:「Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made . The reason I made copies for everyone was so you would n't be embarrassed .」
