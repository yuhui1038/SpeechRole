It feels like a genuine, in-the-moment reaction. Model B is also coherent, accurately summarizing the feeling of betrayal. However, its structure is more of a retrospective summary (\"It felt like...\") rather than an immediate reaction.

The prosody is more akin to someone recounting the story after the fact, rather than experiencing it in the moment. The pitch is relatively stable, the pace is measured, and the intonation lacks the sharp, desperate quality of true panic.
