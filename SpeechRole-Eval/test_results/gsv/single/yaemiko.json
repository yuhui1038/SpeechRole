Model A utilized more of the provided script, directly quoting two key lines which accurately answered the question based on the in-game lore.

Model B, while using only one line from the script, delivered a more concise and pointed response. Its original sentence felt very much in character—a sharp, direct observation that Yae Miko would make. The overall tone and delivery of Model B were slightly more authentic to the character's sharp wit and confidence.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 9)",
