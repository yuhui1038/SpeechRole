Its logic is flawless and direct, first stating his personal aversion to authority and then adding his desire to empower the other patients. While perfectly coherent, its brevity makes it feel slightly less like a developing conversation and more like a series of strong statements.\n\nBoth are excellent, but Model A's slightly more expansive and step-by-step explanation gives it a minor edge in demonstrating conversational coherence.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
