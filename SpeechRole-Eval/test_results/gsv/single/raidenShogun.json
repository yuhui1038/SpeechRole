Both also effectively incorporated elements from the provided character script.\n\nModel A's response was good, correctly identifying the feelings of anger and pain, and linking them to her duty as the protector of her people.\n\nModel B's response was slightly superior. It not only mentioned anger and sorrow but also delved into a deeper, more specific emotion that is central to the character's motivation: \"对失去无能为力的悔恨\" (the regret of being powerless in the face of loss). This shows a more profound understanding of Ei's trauma following the Cataclysm and why she became so obsessed with the concept of an unchanging eternity. The final line, \"那场灾难，铸下了无法愈合的伤痕\" (That disaster forged a wound that cannot be healed), is also a very powerful and in-character conclusion.\n\n, [Scores]: (9, 10)",
