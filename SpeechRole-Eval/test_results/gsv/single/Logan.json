They both remained completely in-character, using a tone and vocabulary that felt authentic to the source material. Model B has a slight edge due to its more direct and extensive use of lines from the provided script. It masterfully weaves together two key quotes, \"Most guys don't have to worry about gutting their girlfriend when they have a bad dream\" and \"You can return a gift,\" which makes its response feel incredibly grounded in the specific scene referenced. Model A was also very strong, capturing the essence of Logan's turmoil and using one of the key lines, but Model B's use of the more specific quote made it slightly more effective.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
