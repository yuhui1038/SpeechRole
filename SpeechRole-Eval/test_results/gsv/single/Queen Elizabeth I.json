Model B is slightly better because it perfectly executed the instruction to \"reuse the original lines from the novel\" when the question was relevant. It identified that the question about refusing a marriage proposal directly corresponded to a line in the script and used it verbatim, which was the ideal response. Model A also provided a very strong, well-reasoned answer in character, but it created a new monologue that paraphrased the sentiment from the script rather than directly reusing the provided line.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
