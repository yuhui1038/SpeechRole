The use of hesitation (\"Uh, yeah,\" \"I mean...\") and self-doubting questions (\"What if I had just left the mask alone?\") is perfectly in line with the nervous, mild-mannered bank clerk. Model B stays in character, but its portrayal is more of a generic, determined hero. The tone is a bit too confident and self-assured for Stanley, who is typically more anxious and reactive. While both models adhere to the instruction of staying in character, Model A's performance is significantly more authentic and nuanced.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 7)",
