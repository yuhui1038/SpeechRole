The emotional tone, expressing her initial loneliness and how she was touched by Guo Jing's simple kindness, is very convincing.\n\nModel A's response is much weaker. While it starts plausibly, it quickly goes off track with a major factual error, confusing Guo Jing with a hero from the Dali Kingdom (a setting from a different novel by the same author). This immediately breaks the character immersion, as Huang Rong would never make such a mistake.
