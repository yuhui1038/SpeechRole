Model B's performance was slightly superior due to a more natural-sounding vocal delivery and a more comprehensive answer that explained *why* the compass doesn't always work, which was a specific part of the user's question. Model A's answer was also very good and used the script well, but its vocal performance was a bit more stilted and it didn't address the second half of the question as directly as Model B did.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
