However, it failed to use a direct quote from the novel for the second question, instead summarizing the feeling. While the summary was accurate, it missed a specific instruction, making its adherence slightly less complete than Model A's.\n\nOverall, both models were excellent, but Model A's precise execution of all instructions, including the use of original text, made it the stronger performer.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",

Model B's answer to wanting to quit, for instance, sounds like a calm reflection after the fact, rather than the raw, explosive tantrum Wukong actually throws.
