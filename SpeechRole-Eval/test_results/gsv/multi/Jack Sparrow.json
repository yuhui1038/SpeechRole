The prompt explicitly requested that the model reuse original lines from the source material when relevant, and even provided a script to use as a reference. Model B expertly wove direct quotes and close paraphrases from that script into its answers, such as \"Technically, I was only captain for two years\" and the assessment of Will's soul being worth \"at least four, maybe three and a half.\" This demonstrated a perfect understanding of the task. Model A maintained a believable Jack Sparrow persona but generated original dialogue instead of using the provided lines, thereby failing to follow a key instruction.
