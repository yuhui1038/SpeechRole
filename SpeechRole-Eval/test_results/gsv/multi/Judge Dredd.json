Model A provided more substantive answers, explaining Dredd's reasoning with logical, in-character justifications that went beyond the provided script. Model B's first two responses were weaker, as they relied almost entirely on quoting the character script directly, with the first response not even answering the \"why\" of the question. While technically in-character, it felt less like a genuine response and more like a simple repetition of source material.
