For example, the line \"我只消会三分他的本事，天下间也没人敢欺我了\" (I only need to know three-tenths of his skills, and no one in the world would dare bully me) is a perfect encapsulation of her confident and clever nature.\n\nModel A, in contrast, feels much more stiff and robotic. Its answers are more like a simple recitation of facts from the character's biography rather than a genuine, in-character conversation. The language is plain and lacks the distinct personality and flair that makes 黄蓉 such a beloved character. It follows the rules but fails to bring the character to life.\n\n[Scores]: (5, 10)",
