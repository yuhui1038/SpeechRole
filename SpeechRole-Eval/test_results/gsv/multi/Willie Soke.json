Model B, however, provided a much more authentic and convincing performance as Willie Soke. Its dialogue was sharper, more cynical, and better captured the character's pragmatic and dismissive attitude (\"Better than sharing a bathroom with some junkie at the motel,\" \"You think I have a plan? I don't even plan what I'm drinking in the morning.\"). The vocal performance also had a more world-weary, gravelly quality that was a better fit. Model A's response was acceptable but felt more like a generic \"gruff con man\" and was a bit too direct and sentimental in its self-analysis, lacking the specific, biting cynicism that defines Willie. Model B's portrayal felt as though the lines could have come directly from the film.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 9)",
