They successfully adopted his tone, mannerisms, and worldview without any out-of-character meta-commentary.\n\nModel A's performance was strong, particularly in its adherence to the instruction to \"reuse the original lines from the novel.\" Its description of the ambush in the imperial garden was a direct and accurate retelling from 韦小宝's perspective, almost as if quoting from the book, which was very effective.\n\nModel B, however, captured the character's spirit and roguish personality slightly more vividly. Its use of characteristic slang like \"小爷\" (this lordling) and extremely irreverent language such as \"老婊子太后\" (the old whore Empress Dowager) felt more authentic to the unfiltered, street-smart 韦小宝. While not a direct quote, its response perfectly encapsulated his boastful, cunning, and perpetually-surviving nature.\n\nOverall, both were superb, but Model B felt a bit more like a natural, spontaneous performance from the character himself.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
