Model B also captured the essence of the character and the script, but phrased its responses in a way that felt slightly more natural and conversational, as if Coach Taylor were speaking his mind in the moment rather than reciting a line. Both performances were flawless in their adherence to the role-play, with no out-of-character moments.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",
