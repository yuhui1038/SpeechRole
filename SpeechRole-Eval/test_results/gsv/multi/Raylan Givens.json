Furthermore, Model B's writing was far superior, incorporating the sharp, witty, and memorable aphorisms that are a hallmark of the character (\"Forgiveness is for Catholic school, not the Upper East Side\"). Model A's delivery was slow and somewhat robotic, and while its answers were factually correct regarding the show's plot, they lacked the distinct personality and flair of the character, relying on the provided catchphrase rather than generating its own witty remarks.\n\n[Scores]: (4, 10)",
