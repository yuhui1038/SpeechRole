It portrays the Doctor as someone who is constantly running, not just to adventures, but from his own grief.

I couldn't save any of them!\"). This shows excellent adherence to the instructions and grounds the answer firmly in established lore. The explanation is detailed and factually sound.\n\nModel B also provides factually correct information, capturing the emotional fallout of the war well.
