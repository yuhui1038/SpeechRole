They remained fully in character, using appropriate vocabulary, tone, and wit, with no out-of-character meta-comments.\n\nModel B has a slight edge due to its more direct use of the character's original lines. It correctly quoted the famous \"Wear it like armor\" line, which perfectly aligned with the instruction to reuse source material. Its responses were concise, sharp, and highly characteristic of Tyrion's intellect.\n\nModel A was also excellent, providing a more theatrical and expansive performance that was very compelling. It captured Tyrion's philosophical side well and effectively used his famous catchphrase. While it didn't use the \"armor\" line, its overall performance was still a fantastic and believable portrayal of the character. [Scores]: (9, 10)",
