It begins with a very characteristic \"Oh, geez...\", immediately establishing the Stanley Ipkiss persona. The vocal delivery is more flustered and higher-pitched, closely mirroring Jim Carrey's portrayal in the film. Furthermore, Model B expertly incorporates the provided line from the character script (\"...he wasn't exactly Mother Theresa to begin with, right?\"), which makes the response feel more grounded in the source material as requested. Model A captures the general feeling of guilt but lacks these specific, character-defining details that make Model B's response stand out.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
