The sections designated for their answers are empty.\n\nTo be helpful, I can outline the criteria for what would constitute a good, coherent response to the question from Leonard Shelby's perspective.\n\n**Criteria for a Coherent \"Leonard Shelby\" Response:**\n\nA strong response to \"Why are you so sure that Teddy is the one who killed your wife?\" would reflect Leonard's unique cognitive state. His conviction isn't based on memory, but on the physical \"facts\" he carries. Therefore, a coherent answer would include:\n\n1.  **Reference to the System:** Leonard would ground his certainty in his system of notes, photos, and tattoos. The most crucial piece of evidence he has against Teddy is the Polaroid picture of him on which Leonard himself wrote, \"DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES. HE IS THE ONE. KILL HIM.\" A coherent response would almost certainly mention this.\n2.  **Citation of \"Facts\":** He would state the facts as he knows them from his notes: that Teddy's real name is John Gammell (John G.), and that his license plate number matches the one tattooed on his thigh. This is the evidence that allows him to make the connection.\n3.  **Unyielding Tone:** The tone should be certain and resolute, possibly with hints of paranoia. From his perspective, the facts are incontrovertible. He must trust his own handwriting. Any expression of doubt would be incoherent with the mindset of the character at the point where he has decided to kill Teddy. He would not, for example, recall Teddy's explanation that the first John G. is already dead, as that is a new memory he is actively choosing to erase.\n\nAn answer that includes these elements would be highly coherent with the character's established logic and worldview within the film's narrative. Without the actual responses, however, I cannot perform a comparative evaluation.\n\n, [Scores]: (0, 0)",

The dialogue should sound fragmented, as if he's looking at his clues for the first time again.

He would then reference the \"facts\"—the license plate number (SG 13 7IU) matching his tattoo, and Teddy's real name being John Gammell.
