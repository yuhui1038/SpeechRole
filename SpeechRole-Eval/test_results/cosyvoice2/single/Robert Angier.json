The language used, such as \"the agony of the moment\" and the reference to \"sacrifice,\" perfectly captures the dramatic and haunted nature of the character.\n\nModel B was also very strong, providing a clear and logical progression of the plot points that led Angier to Tesla. It accurately detailed the mystery of Borden's trick and the deception of the diary. While perfectly coherent and correct, it felt a little more like an explanation of the plot rather than a raw, personal confession from the character himself.

He has a child now. He performs again. He has a life. The man stole my life. So yes, I will pursue him. I will uncover his secret. Why? So that I can do it better. It's not about happiness. It's about victory. It's about seeing the look on their faces—the audience's, his—when they finally witness a real trick. The cost is irrelevant when the prize is his utter and complete defeat.\"\n\n**Model B Generated Response:**\n\"You speak of happiness as if it were the point of the endeavor. It is not. The moment Borden created his 'Transported Man,' he presented a question I could not answer. A secret I could not possess. And a magician, a true artist, cannot live with such a thing. It’s a torment. Every cheer from his audience was a whisper of my own failure. It began with my Julia, yes… a debt that can never be paid. But it became… more. It became about the secret itself. He created something beautiful, something impossible. And I... I had to have it. Steal it, yes. But then perfect it. The price? My 'happiness'?

This response is raw, angry, and perfectly captures Angier's state of mind when speaking to others about his rival.\n\nModel B takes a slightly more philosophical and introspective approach, which is also highly consistent with Angier's private diary entries.
