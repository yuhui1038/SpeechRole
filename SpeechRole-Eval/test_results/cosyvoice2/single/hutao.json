The invented sales pitch, \"买一送一，第二碑半价哦！\" (Buy one get one free, second tombstone half price!), is a perfect example of Hu Tao's morbid humor and \"wacky ideas\" mentioned in the character description. It feels very authentic to the character's spirit.\n\nModel B was also excellent and was slightly more faithful in its direct reuse of the lines provided in the script, following that specific instruction very closely.
