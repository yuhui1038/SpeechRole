Your reputation, Lord Blackwood, and the superstitious fear of your jailers did the rest.\n\nFor the grand finale, the *pièce de résistance* of your supposed resurrection, more elaborate preparation was required. The sandstone slab covering your tomb, for instance. A simple but effective deception. You had it broken *before* your burial, then pieced back together with a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe, if I'm not mistaken—a simple mixture of egg and honey. Designed to be washed away by the first rain or, failing that, conveniently eaten by the local fauna. Once the seal was broken, it was a simple matter to emerge. No magic, my lord. Merely chemistry, and a healthy dose of misdirection.The answer, my good fellow, is that once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. The notion of a man returning from the dead is, of course, an impossibility. Therefore, one must look for the trick.\n\nIt was never a question of supernatural power, but of clever manipulation. **There was never any magic.
