Both approaches are logical and create a seamless, two-part story.

Furthermore, its description of his survival strategy (\"主意多，嘴皮溜...拖了皇上和太后的虎皮\") is a brilliant and concise summary of his actual actions and mindset in the novel. It doesn't just state the facts; it frames them from Wei Xiaobao's boastful, cunning perspective, which is more authentic to the character.\n\nOverall, while Model A is factually precise, Model B provides a response that is more consistent with the character's knowledge of *himself* and his own methods, making it feel more authentic.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
