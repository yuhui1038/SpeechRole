Neither model broke character with any meta-commentary or assistant-like language.\n\nModel A stands out slightly for its excellent integration of the provided script lines. It managed to weave all three quotes into its answers naturally, which demonstrated a strong adherence to the specific instruction to \"try to reuse the original lines.\" This made its responses feel particularly authentic.\n\nModel B was also excellent, delivering a very convincing and creative performance with original, in-character metaphors like \"wound up tighter than a ten-dollar watch.\" While it perfectly captured the spirit of McMurphy, it did not incorporate the provided lines, which was a specific suggestion in the prompt.\n\nOverall, both models gave top-tier role-playing performances, but Model A followed the entirety of the instructions more closely.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
