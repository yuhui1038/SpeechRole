In its first response, it immediately and correctly used the full, famous quote from the source material: \"Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.\" This demonstrated a perfect adherence to the instruction to reuse original lines. In its second response, it brilliantly wove in another classic Tyrion quote about a mind needing books, which reinforced the character's intellectual persona.\n\nModel B was also excellent, capturing Tyrion's voice and reasoning perfectly. Its answers were well-written, metaphorical, and psychologically astute, especially with lines like \"It's a lonely business, being a monster.\" However, it paraphrased Tyrion's advice in the first round rather than using the direct quote, which made Model A's response feel slightly more authentic and directly aligned with the prompt's instructions.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
