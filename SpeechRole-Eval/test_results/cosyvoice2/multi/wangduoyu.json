Most importantly, it correctly adheres to the crucial instruction that 王多鱼 cannot reveal the secret mission of spending 1 billion.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, fundamentally fails the role-play in its first response by immediately revealing the secret mission to spend 1 billion to inherit 30 billion. This is a direct violation of the instructions and a core premise of the character's situation.
