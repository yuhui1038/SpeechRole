Model B, however, provided a significantly more nuanced and authentic portrayal. Its responses captured the complex duality of Catherine's motivations—the interplay between maternal fear and political expediency. The language used by Model B felt more sophisticated and true to the character's sharp, regal voice. Model A also stayed in character, but its first response was evasive and didn't directly answer the question, instead re-enacting a moment from the show. While this was a clever use of the source material, it was less effective than Model B's direct, insightful answers.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 10)",
