In contrast, Model B paraphrases key ideas, adds personal context (\"My dad never understood it\"), and answers the follow-up question with specific examples of *how* Pat maintained his mindset (reading, running, therapy), creating a much more authentic and conversational interaction that feels true to the character's journey.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",
