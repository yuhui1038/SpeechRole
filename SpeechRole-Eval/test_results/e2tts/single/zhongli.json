This shows a deep understanding of the prompt's requirements. The response is a near-perfect replication of Zhongli's canonical dialogue regarding the Liyue Qixing, capturing his exact sentiments and tone. Model A stays in character but fails to use the provided canonical lines, instead paraphrasing the idea and even contradicting a key point from the original script (\"exceeded my expectations\" vs. \"as I expected\").
