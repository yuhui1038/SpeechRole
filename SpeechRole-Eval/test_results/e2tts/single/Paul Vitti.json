Model B was also very good, using a great, specific detail from the film (\"I was singing West Side Story for three days straight\") which showed deep knowledge of the character.

The shift to questioning the therapist (\"Now you're the doctor, right?\") and the setup (\"What's the deal with this couch?\") is perfectly in character and maintains coherence by showing Vitti's discomfort and need to control the situation, which is central to his personality in the films.\n\nModel B also provides a direct and coherent answer, perfectly aligning with the provided script context. Its strength lies in using a specific, memorable detail from the movie (\"I was singing West Side Story for three days straight\"). This makes the response highly authentic and grounded in the source material. The logic is straightforward: he had to act crazy to get out, and here's an example of how crazy he acted.\n\nBoth are excellent, but Model A's response feels slightly more dynamic, capturing the way Vitti would deflect and try to dominate a conversation.
