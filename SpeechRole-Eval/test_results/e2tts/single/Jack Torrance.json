It captures the essence of a man who believes he is more in control than ever, even as he's losing his mind.\n\nModel B is also very good, portraying Jack as someone trying to rationalize the strange influence of the hotel. The performance is convincing, framing the hotel's effect as a source of \"inspiration\" that is \"sharpening\" his mind. However, Model A's delivery feels slightly more chilling and closer to the unhinged Jack Torrance from the climax of the story.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

This resentful lashing out at his family is a core component of his character's breakdown.
