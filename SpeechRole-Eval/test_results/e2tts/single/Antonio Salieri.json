They stayed fully in character as Antonio Salieri, adopted his tone and mannerisms, and successfully incorporated the provided script lines into their responses without any out-of-character meta-commentary. Model A's delivery was slightly more formal and dramatic, as if addressing the court directly. Model B's response felt a bit more intimate and conspiratorial, like Salieri confessing his thoughts, which was enhanced by the excellent inclusion of the Italian word \"cattivo\"â€”a specific character trait from the film that demonstrated a deeper understanding of the role. While both were superb, Model B's nuanced addition gave it a slight edge.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

This makes the response feel slightly less like a personal recollection and more like a direct script reading.
