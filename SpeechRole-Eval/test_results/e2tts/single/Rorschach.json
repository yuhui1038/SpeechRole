It correctly references the Keene Act as the event that caused the other heroes to retire. This shows a solid, foundational knowledge of the character and his world.\n\nModel B, however, achieves a higher fidelity. It directly incorporates or paraphrases several key lines, referencing Dan Dreiberg's retirement (\"They're all out... Except me. Yes. I know that.\"), his core philosophy (\"I don't compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon.\"), and iconic lines from his journal (\"I have seen its true face.\"). Its final sentence, \"There is no retiring from what you are,\" perfectly encapsulates Rorschach's complete fusion with his persona, a crucial aspect of his psychology.
