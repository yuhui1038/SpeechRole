While this captures a simple \"娇憨\" (coy/childish) aspect, it lacks the underlying intelligence, wit, and confidence that are core to 黄蓉's personality. The prosody is consistent within the clip but presents a one-dimensional interpretation of the character.\n\n**Model B Evaluation:**\n- **Prosody:** This model's prosody is much more nuanced and character-aligned. The voice has a light, lilting quality that perfectly embodies the \"聪明伶俐\" and \"娇憨可爱\" traits. The intonation is expressive and confident, especially when dismissing \"拳脚功夫\" as \"枯燥\" and proudly mentioning her father's more sophisticated knowledge (\"爹爹的奇门五行...\").
