Model B also stays in character and attempts to answer from Guo Jing's perspective, but it fails to use the original lines.

His wish for an external resolution (\"若是大汗肯收回成命\") is highly characteristic of his non-confrontational and slightly passive nature when faced with complex emotional dilemmas. Model B creates a plausible summary of the events but misses the nuance of Guo Jing's character. The phrase \"此事于心无愧\" (I have a clear conscience about this matter) feels too decisive and self-assured for Guo Jing, who was deeply troubled and felt immense guilt over breaking his promise and hurting Huazheng, even if he knew he had to follow his heart.

The response is completely faithful to the character's knowledge and emotions as depicted in the source material.\n\nModel B's response starts out consistent with the character's feelings but then makes a significant factual error. It claims that Guo Jing resigned his position as the Khan's son-in-law (\"辞去了驸马之位\") and feels \"no guilt\" about it (\"于心无愧\"). This is a gross misrepresentation of the novel's plot. The resolution of the engagement was a tragic and violent affair that led directly to his mother's suicide and his flight from the Mongols. It was a source of immense grief and conflict for Guo Jing, not a simple matter he could feel \"no guilt\" about. This demonstrates a critical lack of knowledge about one of the most pivotal moments in the character's life.\n\nTherefore, Model A is far superior due to its perfect adherence to the established facts of the novel.\n\n, [Scores]: (10, 3)",
