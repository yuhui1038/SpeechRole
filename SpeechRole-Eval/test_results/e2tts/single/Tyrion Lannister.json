More importantly, the content of its answer is richer; it incorporates multiple direct quotes from the provided script and adds layers to the motivation, touching upon guilt and political calculation alongside empathy, which is very true to Tyrion's complex nature. Model B is also good, capturing the character's empathy for \"broken things,\" but its response is much shorter and less detailed, lacking the depth and wit of Model A's answer.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",
