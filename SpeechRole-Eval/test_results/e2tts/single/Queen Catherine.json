They stayed completely in character as Queen Catherine, adopting her regal, calculating, and slightly menacing tone. Both correctly identified that her primary motivation was to protect her son, Francis, due to Nostradamus's prophecy.\n\nModel A's performance was marginally better. The language used, such as \"a vision as clear as the blood that would be spilled\" and an engagement that \"promised only a tomb for the future King of France,\" felt more dramatic and true to the character's theatrical nature. The vocal delivery had a sharper, more imperious quality that perfectly matched the Queen's persona.\n\nModel B was also very strong and accurate, but its phrasing and delivery were slightly more subdued and less distinctive than Model A's. While perfectly in character, it lacked that extra flair that made Model A's response so memorable.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
