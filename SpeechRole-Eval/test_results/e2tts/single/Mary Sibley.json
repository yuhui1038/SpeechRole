Model A chose to use the exact quote provided in the character script, which was a specific instruction in the prompt. Its vocal delivery was exceptionally well-suited to the character, capturing the slow, deliberate, and menacing tone of Mary Sibley from the show \"Salem.\" Model B generated an original response that was also perfectly in character, using language and themes consistent with the persona. While its vocal performance was good and villainous, Model A's was a more specific and convincing imitation of the character's unique cadence and delivery. Because Model A more closely followed the instruction to use provided lines and delivered a more authentic vocal performance, it is the stronger response.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
