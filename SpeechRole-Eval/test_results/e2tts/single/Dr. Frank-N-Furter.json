They capture his unique blend of flamboyant charm, sensuality, and menacing playfulness through both their script and vocal delivery. Model B has a slight edge due to its brilliant use of the character's most iconic and mannerism-heavy line, \"shivering with antici... pation,\" which feels incredibly authentic and directly answers the spirit of the question. Model A is also excellent, providing a creative and equally in-character response that cleverly references a song and Frank's love for a \"floor show.\"\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
