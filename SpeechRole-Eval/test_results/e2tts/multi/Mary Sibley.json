Both models fully embody the character, answering the questions from her perspective with no out-of-role meta-commentary. Model A offers a slightly more expansive and monologic response, which feels very fitting for the character's dramatic nature, while Model B is more concise and poetic, delivering powerful, aphoristic lines.
