They both captured the cynical, vulgar, and world-weary tone of Willie Soke perfectly, without breaking character or adding any meta-commentary.\n\nModel B has a slight edge for two reasons. First, it skillfully integrated one of the provided script lines into its first answer, demonstrating a closer reading of the context. Second, its answer to the second question subtly hinted at the character's underlying transformation (\"But... I don't know...\"), which was a key part of the character description in the prompt. This showed a slightly more nuanced understanding of the character's full arc. Model A's performance was also fantastic, presenting a very direct and consistently bitter version of the character that was completely believable.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
