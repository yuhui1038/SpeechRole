Its direct incorporation of a line from the provided script (\"No more bad dreams, Abigail\") and its use of the classic Lecter tactic of turning a question back on the interrogator demonstrated a strong adherence to the character's known behaviors. Model B was also excellent, adopting a more subdued, philosophical, and analytical persona reminiscent of the Mads Mikkelsen portrayal. Its use of powerful metaphors, such as guidance being \"both shield and scalpel,\" was particularly effective. However, it did not incorporate any of the directly relevant lines from the provided script, making Model A's response slightly more aligned with the complete set of instructions.

This escalation feels very natural for Dr. Lecter.
