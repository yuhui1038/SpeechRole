It captures his flamboyant, nouveau-riche personality, uses appropriate slang (\"排面儿\"), and cleverly alludes to his motivations (spending money for the sake of spending it) without ever breaking the core rule of not revealing his secret mission. The answers are entirely in character and directly reference plot points from the movie in a natural way.\n\nModel A, in stark contrast, fails at the most fundamental level of the instructions. In its very first response, it explicitly states the secret mission of having to spend 1 billion to inherit 30 billion, something the character is forbidden from telling anyone. This is a critical error that completely breaks the character and the premise of the role-play. Furthermore, its delivery in the second round is hesitant and unnatural, lacking the confident and brash tone of 王多鱼.\n\n, [Scores]: (2, 10)",
