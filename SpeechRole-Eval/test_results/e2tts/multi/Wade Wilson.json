The voice is too deep, slow, and lacks the energetic and sarcastic intonation that defines Deadpool.

Its second answer is also perfectly in character, referencing chimichangas and his general defiant attitude.\n\nModel B is also very strong.

It also grounds its response with specific references to both Vanessa and the villain, Francis, which is a nice touch.\n\nOverall, Model A is slightly better because its use of the source material was more directly relevant to the specific question being asked, showcasing a more precise application of the character's knowledge and lines.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
