Crucially, this rich prosodic profile is maintained consistently across both responses, adapting to the emotional needs of each answer—from raw fury to simmering scorn—while keeping the core character voice intact.\n\nModel B, while maintaining a consistent character voice, is far less effective in its prosodic delivery. The pitch is appropriate, but the intonation is significantly flatter and lacks the dramatic range of Model A. The delivery sounds more like a stern, declarative reading than a passionate, arrogant outburst. The emotional texture that comes from varied pitch and stress is largely absent, making the character feel less alive and less true to the choleric nature of Coriolanus.
