Model B, however, delivered a more compelling and nuanced performance. It incorporated specific details and even a direct quote (\"Perhaps you should consider the cost\") from the film, which added a strong layer of authenticity. Model B's responses also did a better job of capturing the character's complex mix of emotions—not just obsession, but also fear, awe, and a hint of the horror to come. Model A was good and consistent, but its portrayal felt slightly more one-dimensional, focusing primarily on the drive for victory without the darker undertones that Model B captured so effectively.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
