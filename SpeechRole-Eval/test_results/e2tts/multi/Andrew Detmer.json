They successfully captured the persona of a troubled, introverted teenager who is simultaneously fascinated and overwhelmed by his newfound powers.\n\nModel A's performance was very strong. The writing accurately reflected Andrew's character arc, starting with confusion, moving to a feeling of empowerment mixed with fear, and culminating in his \"apex predator\" philosophy. The inclusion of that specific line was a great touch that displayed a deep understanding of the character's descent. The vocal delivery was appropriately subdued and hesitant.\n\nModel B's performance was exceptional. The vocal tone and delivery felt slightly more authentic to a teenager, capturing a raw, emotional quality that was very compelling. The script felt deeply personal, focusing on the psychological relief the powers brought him (\"It was better than being... me\") and his desperate refusal to go back to being a victim. The emotional progression across the three answers was incredibly believable and immersive.\n\nWhile both models were excellent, Model B had a slight edge due to its more nuanced and emotionally resonant vocal performance, which made the character feel more alive.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
