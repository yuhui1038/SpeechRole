It starts with the reason for the duels, moves to the duels being interrupted and turning into a joint battle, and concludes with that battle being the moment of true fellowship. This creates a perfectly cohesive and satisfying story arc. Model A, by contrast, is less coherent. Its first response is confusing, mixing up the timeline by immediately quoting a line (\"there are four of us\") from the later battle scene, rather than describing the initial encounters that led to the duels.
