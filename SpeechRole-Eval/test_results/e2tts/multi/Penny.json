Model A was exceptional, perfectly capturing Penny's voice, her mix of exasperation and affection for Sheldon, and her conversational, non-academic vocabulary. Its descriptions felt natural and completely in-character across all three rounds. Model B also performed well and had some strong moments, like coining the term \"Sheldon-y\" and referencing the specific \"knocking\" rule. However, it made a significant character-breaking error by using the word \"aberrant,\" a term far too academic for Penny. This slip slightly undermined the authenticity of the portrayal. Model A was more consistent and believable.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",
