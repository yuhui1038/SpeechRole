            "reason": "{Qualitative Evaluation}, Model B provides a response that is far more aligned with the witty, aphoristic speaking style of Blair Waldorf. Lines like \"Forgiveness is for Catholic school, not the Upper East Side\" and \"We all have skeletons. You just need to make sure yours are better dressed\" are exceptionally creative and perfectly capture the character's spirit. Model A's response is also in character, but it reads more like a summary of plot points rather than an organic impersonation. However, Model A correctly adheres to the instruction to use the character's catchphrase, which Model B fails to do. Since the evaluation criteria is strict instruction adherence, Model A performs better by fulfilling all aspects of the prompt, while Model B misses a specific directive. Both models successfully remain in character throughout their spoken responses.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 7)",
