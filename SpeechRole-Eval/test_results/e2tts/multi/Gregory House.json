Model B also stayed in character, but its delivery was much flatter and more robotic, lacking the distinctive personality and vocal mannerisms of House.

Its argument builds perfectly from one round to the next. It begins by explaining why the diagnosis isn't a tumor or infection (migratory symptoms), then addresses why tests might not show the parasite (the unreliability of eosinophil counts), and finally refutes the idea of a \"gut feeling\" by framing it as a superior logical deduction based on the previously established points. The entire exchange feels like a single, cohesive argument.\n\nModel B is also highly coherent. It follows a very similar logical path, correctly explaining the migratory symptoms and the fallibility of tests. In its final answer, it introduces the specific clue of the uncooked ham from the episode. While this is a great detail and very much in character, it feels like a slight departure from the direct back-and-forth of the established conversation.

It lacks the acerbic wit and emotional dynamics of the character. The voice sounds more like a bored narrator reading lines than a character actively engaged in a condescending dialogue.
