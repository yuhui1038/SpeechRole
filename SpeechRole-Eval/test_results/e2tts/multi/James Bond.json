This demonstrated a deeper understanding of the requested context. Model A's portrayal was also strong, but it made an anachronistic reference to a character from a different Bond film, which slightly undermined its adherence to the specific \"Tomorrow-Never-Dies\" instruction.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 10)",
