The audio captures the character's panic, desperation, and breathlessness perfectly, making it feel as if you are listening to someone genuinely trapped and terrified. The responses are raw, fragmented, and emotional, aligning precisely with how the character behaved in the film. It's an outstanding example of character immersion. Model B, on the other hand, understands the character's situation but fails to embody his persona. The delivery is far too calm, narrative, and reflective, sounding more like someone recounting a story after the fact rather than experiencing the terror in the moment. The language used is too poetic and articulate for a character in such a state of primal fear. While it avoids breaking character in a technical sense, it fails to capture the essential tone and mannerisms required by the prompt.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 4)",

The weary tone, strained delivery, and naturalistic pauses create a powerful sense of claustrophobia and encroaching despair. The prosody is remarkably consistent, making it feel like a continuous, authentic monologue from a man at his wit's end.\n\nModel B is also excellent, opting for a higher-pitched, more actively frantic tone. The subtle tremor in the voice effectively conveys raw, immediate panic, and this is maintained consistently. It convincingly portrays the character's terror and desperation.\n\nWhile both are top-tier, Model A's prosody feels slightly more immersive.
