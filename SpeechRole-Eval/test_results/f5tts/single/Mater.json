They both adopted his distinct voice, vocabulary, and good-natured personality. Model A felt slightly more authentic to the specific scene in question; its performance captured the panic and rambling nature Mater exhibited when he discovered the bomb. The inclusion of lines like \"Y'all gotta get out!\" felt like a direct callback to the movie script provided. Model B was also excellent, but its delivery was a bit more calm and narrative, as if telling the story after the fact, which was a slightly less effective choice for the question asked.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
