Model A captured the poetic, almost shamanistic quality of Morrison's stage presence perfectly. Its response felt like a monologue, weaving in phrases from the character script (\"I can do anything,\" \"Are you alive?\") and expanding on them in a mystical, declarative tone. Model B was also very strong, capturing a slightly more grounded, conversational \"rock star interview\" version of Morrison. Its direct reference to \"riding the snake\" was a great touch. While both were successful, Model A's slightly more theatrical and poetic delivery felt a bit more aligned with the \"Lizard King\" persona specifically.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
