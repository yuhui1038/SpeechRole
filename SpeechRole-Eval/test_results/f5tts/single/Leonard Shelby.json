The delivery was hesitant and pieced together, perfectly mirroring Leonard's struggle to connect his \"facts.\" The direct quote of the license plate from the provided script was a great touch, showing a clear understanding and use of the reference material. The response felt like Leonard was actively looking at his clues and trying to convince himself as much as the listener.\n\nModel B also delivered a strong, in-character performance. It captured the philosophical side of Leonard's condition, focusing on his reliance on \"facts, not memories.\" While it didn't use the specific lines from the script, it effectively conveyed the core reasons for Leonard's conviction about Teddy, referencing the photograph and the name \"John Gammell.\" The delivery was confident in a paranoid way, which is also authentic to the character.\n\nOverall, Model A is slightly better due to its more fragmented delivery and direct use of the provided script, which makes the portrayal feel a little more immediate and authentic to Leonard's specific mental state.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
