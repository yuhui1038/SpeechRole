The response is coherent within itself, showing Fletcher struggling to tell the truth, but it doesn't progress the conversation in the same way Model A's more mature reflection does.

The pitch range is narrower, and the delivery is slower and less dynamic. The voice is consistent with itself, but it is not consistently aligned with the target character's distinct speaking style.
