It directly addresses the simplicity of the question (\"You mortals love your simple dichotomies\"), which is a very Lestat-like thing to say. It then cohesively explains that direct control was impossible but reframes his position as consort into a form of power itself (\"was that not a form of power in itself?\"). This twist is a logical and character-consistent way to answer the question, preserving Lestat's ego.\n\nModel B is also extremely good, using powerful metaphors like the hurricane and the dawn to describe Akasha's power. The logic is sound and the flow is excellent.
