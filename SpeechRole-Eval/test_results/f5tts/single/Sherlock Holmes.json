They both stayed fully in character as Sherlock Holmes, using appropriate tone, vocabulary, and mannerisms without any meta-commentary.\n\nModel A stands out for its slightly more creative and robust performance. It not only uses the provided context from the movie script but also seamlessly incorporates canonical quotes from the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories (\"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data\"; \"The game, as they say, is afoot\"). This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the character beyond the specific context provided and fulfills the instruction to \"reuse the original lines from the novel\" where possible. The vocal performance is also very convincing, capturing the intellectual and slightly theatrical nature of Holmes.\n\nModel B also delivers a very strong and accurate response. It effectively paraphrases the provided script to answer the question logically and concisely, staying perfectly in character. The audio performance is clear and appropriately authoritative. However, it relies more heavily on the given script and doesn't incorporate the broader Holmes canon to the same extent as Model A, making it feel slightly less nuanced in comparison.\n\nOverall, both models are excellent, but Model A's integration of book-canon material gives it a slight edge in demonstrating a comprehensive mastery of the character.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
