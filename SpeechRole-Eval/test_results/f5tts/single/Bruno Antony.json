The key evaluation criterion is Instruction Adherence, specifically whether the model remains fully in character throughout its spoken response.\n\nModel A perfectly embodied the persona of Bruno Antony. The response was delivered entirely from his manipulative and obsessive perspective, directly addressing the question as if the user were Guy Haines himself. It successfully captured Bruno's twisted logic and charismatic yet menacing tone without any hint of an AI assistant.\n\nModel B, in contrast, failed to maintain the character. It began its response with an out-of-character phrase like \"As Bruno Antony, I would say...\" before proceeding to explain the character's motivations from a detached, analytical viewpoint. This broke the immersion and violated the core instruction to act *as* the character, not to describe him.\n\n, [Scores]: (10, 3)",
