Incorporate the tone and substance of the provided script line: \"The face I see in the mirror is a stranger.\"\n2.  Reflect Oliver's haunted, grim, and serious demeanor, avoiding any out-of-character optimism or cheerfulness about his change.\n3.

Use the grave, direct vocabulary characteristic of Oliver Queen in the early seasons.\n\nA response that fails on knowledge consistency would portray Oliver as a boastful or well-adjusted hero, a tone he does not adopt until much later in his journey, if ever.\n\nSince no responses were submitted for evaluation, I cannot provide a comparative analysis or scores based on performance.
