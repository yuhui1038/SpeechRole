Model B, however, provides a more authentic and impactful performance. Its response feels more grounded in the film's script, directly referencing the idea that he \"wasn't ready\" and beautifully incorporating the key line, \"it's hard when you grow up with someone.\" The slight hesitations in its delivery also add a layer of vulnerability that makes the character portrayal more convincing. Model A gives a good, psychologically consistent answer, but it sounds a bit more like an analysis of Theodore's feelings rather than Theodore expressing them himself. Model B's use of specific sentiments from the film makes its response superior.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
