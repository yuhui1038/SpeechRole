The voice performance also captured Twilight's slightly frantic and stressed-out nature from the early episodes more accurately. Model B was also very good, providing a plausible in-character reason, but it didn't use the provided script as effectively and its vocal tone was a bit more calm and generic than Model A's.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
