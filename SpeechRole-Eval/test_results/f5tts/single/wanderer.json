They both successfully adopted his cynical and aloof tone.\n\nModel A's performance was slightly superior. It opened with a suspicious, rhetorical question (\"啊？问这个什么意思？\") which perfectly captures the character's guarded and abrasive personality. It then delivered the most relevant in-game quote in its entirety, directly and completely answering the user's question about his former colleagues. The delivery in the audio was calm and dismissive, fitting the character perfectly.\n\nModel B also performed very well, combining two different in-game voice lines to form its answer. While this also demonstrates a good understanding of the character, the chosen lines focused slightly more on his own situation and future plans rather than directly on his view of the other Harbingers. By contrast, Model A's use of a single, highly relevant quote felt more direct and impactful.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
