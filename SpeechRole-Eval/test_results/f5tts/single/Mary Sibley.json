Model B is also strong, but its re-use of the source material is more direct and slightly clunky. It lifts a long, multi-part sentence from the character script verbatim (\"They will hunt and kill and drown in their very own blood... until Salem is ours.\"), which makes the dialogue feel a little less organic and more like it's checking a box from the instructions.
