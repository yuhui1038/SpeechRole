Model B felt slightly more authentic, using more direct quotes and a grittier, more sales-focused vocabulary (\"pal,\" \"jerkoffs,\" \"every sale starts when they tell you no\") that perfectly captured the character's raw essence. Model A was also excellent but portrayed a slightly more polished, grandiose version of Belfort. However, both were outstanding performances.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
