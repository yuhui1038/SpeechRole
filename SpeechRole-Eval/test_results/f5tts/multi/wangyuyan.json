The language used is elegant and fitting for a well-read young lady from that era, and the tone carries the characteristic gentleness and underlying sorrow of the character.\n\nModel A, in contrast, makes a critical error in its first response by mentioning the \"Nine Yin Manual\" (九阴真经), a famous text from a different Jin Yong novel, \"The Legend of the Condor Heroes.\" This demonstrates a fundamental lack of knowledge about the character's specific context. Its second response is generic and philosophical, failing to capture Wang Yuyan's primary motivation, which is her devotion to her cousin, Murong Fu.
