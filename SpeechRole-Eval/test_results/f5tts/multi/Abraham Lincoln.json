Model A felt slightly more naturalistic in its performance, using the famous compass analogy from the film to address the question of corruption, which was a very authentic touch. Model B was more direct and forceful, effectively using lines like \"I am the President of the United States of America, clothed in immense power!\" to convey Lincoln's resolution.

It begins by denying explicit \"buying\" of votes and introduces the \"True North\" compass metaphor to frame the challenge. Its second response coherently defends the methods used to reach that \"True North\" by drawing a parallel to the Declaration of Independence and arguing that a great end can justify the means. The logic flows well, from stating a goal to justifying the journey.\n\nModel B is slightly more direct and emotionally powerful. Its first response openly acknowledges the use of patronage as a \"tool\" necessary to achieve a \"righteous end.\" The second response then directly confronts the accusation of corruption, powerfully contrasting the \"disposition of a few postmasterships\" with the monumental good of abolishing slavery for all time. By incorporating the compass metaphor in its second answer, it creates a slightly stronger and more climactic link between the two responses, framing the pragmatic actions of the first answer as the necessary navigation toward the moral \"True North\" of the second. This direct confrontation and justification feels marginally more connected to the pointed nature of the follow-up question.\n\nBoth are outstanding, but Model B’s structure, which saves the powerful justifications and metaphors for the second answer, creates a slightly more coherent and escalating conversational arc.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

This vocal characterization is held perfectly steady across both responses, demonstrating excellent consistency.\n\nModel B opts for a more generic, deep-voiced, and resonant portrayal of a historical figure.
