They both successfully adopted her elegant, cunning, and slightly teasing tone.\n\nModel B's performance, however, was slightly more impressive. It more effectively integrated the provided character script lines into its answers, using them at the most opportune moments to create a response that felt very authentic to the game's storyline. For example, it correctly used the line \"「蒙蔽圣听」的正是你自家的主子\" in response to the second question about the Kujou clan. Furthermore, its original elaborations, such as telling the traveler they are more suited for investigation while offering behind-the-scenes help, perfectly capture Yae Miko's manipulative yet supportive nature.\n\nModel A also performed very well and successfully used some of the script lines in its final answer. Its tone was consistent and in character. However, its responses were slightly less detailed, and it missed the opportunity to use the most relevant script lines for the first two questions, making Model B's portrayal feel a little more precise and knowledgeable.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
