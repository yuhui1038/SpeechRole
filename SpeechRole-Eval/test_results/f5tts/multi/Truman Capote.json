They remained in character as Truman Capote throughout all three rounds, effectively using the provided script and adopting the persona's distinct tone and mannerisms. There were no instances of out-of-role comments or assistant-like behavior from either model.\n\nModel A was particularly effective, weaving direct quotes from the script into its responses seamlessly. The delivery felt natural and captured the character's blend of intellectual vanity, emotional vulnerability, and artistic obsession. The line, \"If that's crossing a line, then what great writer hasn't?\" was a particularly strong, in-character addition.\n\nModel B was also very strong, capturing the essence of the character and using key lines from the script. Its original additions, such as calling the relationship a \"terrible symbiosis,\" were insightful and fitting. However, Model A's performance felt slightly more polished and closer to the specific cadence and self-dramatizing nature of the character as portrayed in the film *Capote*.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

The answers are logically connected, moving from the relationship to the moral line to the final effect, but they feel more like distinct, theatrical statements rather than a continuous, evolving internal monologue. The transition between the answers is present but lacks the seamless, cause-and-effect flow demonstrated by Model A, whose responses feel like they are being pulled from the same continuous stream of thought.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",
