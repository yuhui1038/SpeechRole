They both fully adopt the specified persona without any out-of-character remarks.\n\nModel B has a slight edge because it more accurately and consistently uses direct quotes from the film's script, as requested by the prompt for questions related to the story. The user's questions are essentially a paraphrased version of the courtroom cross-examination, and Model B's responses are the exact, powerful lines Jessep delivers in that scene. This precision makes its performance feel more authentic and directly aligned with the source material.\n\nModel A also does a fantastic job of capturing the character's arrogant and defiant tone. While it doesn't use as many direct quotes, its paraphrasing and original lines are perfectly in character and convey the same meaning and attitude. It's a very strong interpretation, but slightly less precise than Model B's use of the original script.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

Model B, while capturing the character's tone, is less coherent. Its initial answer is somewhat contradictory by stating he both discourages the practice and lets it happen.
