In the second round, the shift from feigned, higher-pitched concern for Maurice to a lower, more conspiratorial tone when revealing the plan is particularly effective and showcases a nuanced understanding of the character's manipulative side. The contempt and indignation in the final round are also perfectly captured through sharp, stressed syllables and scornful intonation.\n\nModel B also provides a good performance, maintaining an arrogant and booming tone. However, its prosody is less varied and dynamic than Model A's. The tone remains largely the same across the different scenarios—mostly just loud and boastful. While this is certainly a key part of Gaston's character, it misses the subtler, manipulative shifts that Model A captures so well.
