Its answers felt more directly tied to the specific plot of the film from which the provided script is taken. For instance, in the second response, it explicitly mentions the pattern of the cross formed by the murder locations on the map, a key detail from the story. This demonstrates a deeper and more precise integration of the context. Model A was also very good, but its answers were slightly more generic to the Holmes character rather than specific to this particular case. [Scores]: (9, 10)",
