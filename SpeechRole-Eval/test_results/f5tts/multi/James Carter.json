The final response, which included a desire for \"moo shu\" and the character's signature catchphrase, was a particularly strong touch that made the performance feel more complete and specific to the character.\n\nModel B was also very good and stayed perfectly in character, capturing the bravado and the underlying loyalty. The responses were believable, but felt a little more like a generic \"brash cop\" archetype compared to Model A's more detailed and specific portrayal of James Carter.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

Its description of Lee as a \"karate-choppin' machine\" is a great character touch.\n\nWhile both are exceptional, Model A's inclusion of more specific Carter-isms gives it a slight edge.
