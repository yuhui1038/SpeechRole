This added a layer of depth and humor that was very true to the film.

While the pace is fast, the prosody feels more like a generic, enthusiastic speaker rather than mimicking the specific, wildly dynamic vocal performance of the character. The stress and pitch remain in a relatively narrow, albeit high-energy, range throughout the three responses.\n\nModel B, in contrast, demonstrates a much better grasp of the character's prosody. The pitch fluctuates dramatically, capturing the shifts between feigned confidence, rising panic, and outright desperation. The stress is placed on words in a way that feels much more natural to the character, emphasizing his frustration and the absurdity of his situation. This dynamic yet character-specific prosody is maintained consistently across all three answers, adapting to the emotional context of each question while still sounding distinctly like Fletcher Reede.\n\n, [Scores]: (6, 9)",

The tone is too calm, self-aware, and remorseful, missing the comedic desperation that defines the character for most of the film. It also makes the mistake of quoting another character's line (\"Max is going to be so disappointed!\") as if Fletcher himself is saying it, which breaks the immersion of the role-play.
