Its answers were specific to the plot of that film, correctly identifying the core motivations for getting the adamantium (revenge for Kayla) and the source of his regret (trusting Stryker). The tone and word choice were perfectly in character. Model A captured a generic, gruff \"Wolverine\" persona but failed to demonstrate specific knowledge of the *Origins* storyline. It incorrectly stated Logan was a \"kid\" during the procedure and gave vague reasons for his actions that don't align with the film's narrative, making its performance much less convincing.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",
