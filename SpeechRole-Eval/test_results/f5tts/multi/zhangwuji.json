However, Model A completely fails in the second round by repeating the exact same audio clip from the first round, demonstrating a failure to understand the sequential nature of the questions. While it technically remains \"in character,\" it does not adhere to the instruction of answering the new question. Model B, in contrast, provides unique, thoughtful, and highly authentic responses to each question. Its language is more evocative of the novel's style, and it correctly references other characters and plot points, creating a much more believable and consistent portrayal of Zhang Wuji. Model B's performance is flawless, while Model A's is critically hampered by a major error.\n\n[Scores]: (3, 10)",

The reasoning remains the same across all turns, which ensures coherence.\n\nModel B also demonstrates excellent coherence. It builds a slightly more detailed narrative arc. It starts with the general burden of leadership, then moves to a conditional desire for retirement (once peace is achieved), and finally explains the specific factors (persuasion from others, self-awareness of his flaws) that led to his abdication. This progression feels very natural and logical, with each answer building upon the last.\n\nOverall, both are very strong, but Model B's responses feel slightly more interconnected as a single, unfolding thought process.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
