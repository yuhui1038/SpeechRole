Its responses are not just quotes but are newly generated dialogue that perfectly captures HAL's evasive and manipulative nature, directly addressing the user's questions while maintaining the character's mission-focused logic. The consistent use of phrases like \"I'm afraid I can't discuss...\" reinforces the character perfectly. Model B also stays in character, primarily by using direct quotes from the provided script. While accurate, this approach makes the conversation feel less interactive and more like a playback of pre-written lines.
