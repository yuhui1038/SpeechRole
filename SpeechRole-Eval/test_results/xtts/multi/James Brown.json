They successfully adopted the persona, tone, and vocabulary without any out-of-character meta-commentary.\n\nModel B was slightly more effective due to its more direct and impactful use of the lines provided in the character script. It seamlessly wove the exact quotes into its answers, making the responses feel more authentic and powerful, as if they were coming directly from the film. Model A also did a great job of capturing the character's voice and paraphrasing the sentiment of the script, but Model B's direct integration of the provided lines gave it a slight edge in fulfilling that specific part of the instructions.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

Model B is very good at directly integrating the provided script lines, but the original text it generates around those quotes is too polished and grammatically proper, losing the raw, energetic personality of the character.
