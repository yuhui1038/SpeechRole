Its language and slang (\"pot dealer buddies,\" \"jerk offs\") also feel more authentic to the character's rougher edges. Model A captures the charismatic, motivational speaker aspect of Belfort very well and perfectly uses a script line in the second round, but it missed a key opportunity to use a provided line in its first response.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
