It spoke in the present tense, conveying the immediate, raw terror and confusion of being buried alive. The frantic, breathless delivery in the audio and the fragmented sentences perfectly captured the character's psychological state. Model B, in contrast, answered the questions from a past-tense, narrative perspective, as if recounting the events after they happened. This made the performance less immersive and less faithful to the instruction of acting like the character *during* his ordeal. Model A's response felt like a live transmission from the coffin, whereas Model B's felt like an interview after the fact.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 6)",
