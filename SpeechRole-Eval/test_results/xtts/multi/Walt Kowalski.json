However, Model B demonstrates a much deeper adherence to the character's specific knowledge and background. It masterfully weaves in direct quotes and specific plot points from the film, such as putting in the steering column himself and his granddaughter Ashley wanting his furniture. This makes its portrayal feel far more authentic and specific to the character. Model A captures the general attitude well but makes a significant error in the second round by referring to the Gran Torino as an F-150 truck, a mistake the car-obsessed Walt would never make. This factual inaccuracy undermines its character adherence.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",
