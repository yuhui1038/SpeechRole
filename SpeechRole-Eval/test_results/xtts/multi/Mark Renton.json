Model A was slightly more immersive, capturing the rambling, stream-of-consciousness style of the character's internal monologue from the novel, and incorporated more Scottish dialect (\"wee bairn,\" \"in it?\"). Model B was also excellent, delivering a more concise and blunt response that was very true to the film's portrayal of the character. Both were highly effective, but Model A's slightly more detailed and dialect-rich performance gave it a marginal edge in authenticity.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
