It was more successful in seamlessly integrating the provided character script lines into its answers, using three of them naturally across the two questions. Model A only used one of the lines. Furthermore, Model A's responses both concluded with odd, gibberish-like phrases that were out of character and broke the immersion of the role-play. Model B's responses felt more authentic and consistent from start to finish.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",
