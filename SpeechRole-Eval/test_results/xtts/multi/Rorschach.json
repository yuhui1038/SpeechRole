Perhaps.\") is a slightly less confrontational and more reflective beat before it pivots to its justification.

Model B also provides a consistent performance with a suitable low pitch, but its delivery is faster and feels more like a straightforward report. It lacks the subtle, menacing undertones and the impactful, deliberate pacing that Model A uses to bring the character's prosody to life.

The voice is gruff and low, but the delivery is more staccato and matter-of-fact, which is truer to Rorschach's journal entries and internal monologue.
