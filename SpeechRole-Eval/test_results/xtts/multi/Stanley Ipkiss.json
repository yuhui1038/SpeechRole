They successfully adopted his persona, blending his timid, anxious nature with the newfound confidence and chaos brought by the mask.\n\nModel B's performance was slightly more impressive due to its use of specific details and references from the film, such as comparing the experience to a \"Tex Avery cartoon.\" Its final answer, about being \"afraid to go back to being invisible again,\" was a particularly insightful and authentic take on the character's core motivation. Model A was also very strong, effectively capturing Stanley's frantic energy and using his catchphrase, but Model B's responses felt a little more nuanced and psychologically grounded in the character.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
