They remained completely in character, using appropriate language, tone, and references without any meta-commentary.\n\nModel A gives more elaborate, theatrical answers, capturing Freddy's sadistic love for monologuing and toying with his victims. The audio has a sinister, raspy quality that fits the character perfectly.\n\nModel B offers shorter, punchier, and more aggressive responses. This captures the more brutal and profane side of Freddy seen in *Freddy vs. Jason*, and the final line of its last response is particularly authentic to that version of the character.\n\nBoth models are outstanding examples of in-character role-playing. Model A excels in its detailed storytelling, while Model B excels in its concise and aggressive delivery. They represent different but equally valid facets of the character's personality.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",
