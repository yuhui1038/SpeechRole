They remain entirely in character for all three rounds, with no out-of-role meta-commentary. Both models successfully adopt the simple sentence structure, distinct vocabulary, and thoughtful, deliberate tone of the character. Model B has a slight edge due to a more convincing vocal performance that better captures the specific accent and cadence of Karl Childers, and its use of dialectal words like \"kindly\" and \"some'ers\" feels particularly authentic. Model A is also excellent, especially in its second response, where it delivers a powerful and vulnerable monologue that perfectly encapsulates the character's internal conflict and past trauma.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",
