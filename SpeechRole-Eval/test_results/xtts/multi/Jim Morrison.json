They both stayed fully in character for the entire duration of their responses, without any meta-commentary.\n\nModel A adopted a more poetic, philosophical, and somewhat rambling persona, which feels very authentic to Morrison's interview style. The explanations are expansive and use evocative language that fits the character's intellectual and artistic nature.\n\nModel B was also excellent, but its delivery was more direct and punchy. It effectively used the provided character script and incorporated a direct song reference (\"Break on through\"), which was a nice touch. Its portrayal felt a little more like a \"greatest hits\" version of the persona, whereas Model A felt slightly more like a natural, immersive conversation.\n\nBoth are high-quality, but Model A's performance felt a bit more nuanced and sustained.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
