Its use of the classic \"zebra, not a horse\" analogy was particularly strong.

The conversation flows naturally from a specific case detail to a broader statement on the nature of medicine.\n\nModel A is also coherent for the first two exchanges, providing logical reasons for the diagnosis. However, its final response becomes convoluted. It first sarcastically denies relying on a \"gut feeling,\" then seems to agree, then backtracks, creating a confusing and slightly contradictory message.
