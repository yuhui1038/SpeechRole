They remained completely in character, with no out-of-role meta-commentary. Model A adopted a more theatrical and conversational tone, directly addressing Watson and using iconic phrases like \"the game's afoot.\" It also skillfully incorporated direct quotes from the provided script. Model B was more terse and analytical, focusing on the cold, hard logic of the deduction, which is also a very authentic interpretation of the character. While both were superb, Model A's performance felt slightly more engaging and directly responsive to the questioner-as-Watson dynamic.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
