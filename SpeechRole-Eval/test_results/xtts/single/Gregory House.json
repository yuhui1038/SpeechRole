        "reason": "Both models successfully adopted the persona of Gregory House and maintained it throughout their responses, strictly adhering to the instructions.\n\nModel A provided a more fleshed-out answer that felt very authentic to the character's style of monologuing. It perfectly captured House's sarcastic, misanthropic, and self-aware tone, even explicitly using his catchphrase \"Everybody lies\" to justify his methods. The concluding line, \"Now, are you going to help me or do I have to do it myself?\" is an excellent representation of his impatient and manipulative nature.\n\nModel B was also very effective, but in a more concise and dismissive manner. The lines are short, punchy, and pragmatic, which is another common way House communicates when he can't be bothered to explain himself. It captures his core belief that results trump rules (\"The law can complain all it wants after the fact. In the meantime, I need answers.\").\n\nWhile both are excellent, Model A's response feels slightly more complete and characteristic of a classic House rant, providing a deeper justification from the character's point of view.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
