The pacing is deliberate, like someone telling a story, and the stress on key words like \"really, really fast\" and \"always\" adds a naturalistic, character-appropriate emphasis.\n\nModel B also demonstrates strong prosodic consistency. It successfully shifts its tone from the dramatic weight of an identity crisis (\"Without itâ€¦ who was I?\") to a lighter, more comedic tone (\"A pretty important part, I might add\"), which is very characteristic of Thor in *Ragnarok*. While the performance is very good, the voice itself sounds slightly more like a generic heroic archetype compared to Model A, which has a timbre that feels a bit closer to the specific character.\n\nOverall, Model A is slightly better due to a more unique voice quality and a prosodic delivery that perfectly aligns with the specific scene it is quoting.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
