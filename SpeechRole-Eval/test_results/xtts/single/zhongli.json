More importantly, it directly quotes the provided character script as instructed, demonstrating excellent adherence to the prompt's specific requirement. Model A's voice is less fitting for the character, sounding a bit higher-pitched and faster-paced. While it attempts to answer in character, it paraphrases and slightly misinterprets the source material, stating that the Qixing's actions were \"as expected,\" whereas the original line states their actions \"exceeded\" his expectations.

Model B starts excellently by using direct quotes from the source material, which is perfectly in character. However, it abruptly cuts off mid-sentence, leaving the thought incomplete.

The repeated use of \"哈哈\" (haha) feels too jovial and out of character for Zhongli, whose amusement is typically more subtle and expressed with a more reserved \"哈\" (a light chuckle).
