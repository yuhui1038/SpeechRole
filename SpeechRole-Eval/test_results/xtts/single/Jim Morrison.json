They both stayed completely in character as Jim Morrison, effectively using a tone and vocabulary that felt authentic to the rock icon. Model A captured the more poetic, shamanistic, and philosophical side of Morrison's persona, weaving in elements from the character script in a way that felt like a monologue or a piece of prose. Model B adopted a slightly more direct, rebellious, rock-and-roll attitude, using punchier phrasing while also successfully integrating the key concepts from the script. Both are stellar interpretations and followed the instructions without deviation.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",
