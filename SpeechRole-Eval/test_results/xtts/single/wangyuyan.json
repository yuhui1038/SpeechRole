It perfectly captures the character of Wang Yuyan by directly quoting the original lines from the novel, just as the instructions requested. It not only uses the provided script but also adds further accurate details (\"青字九打\", \"城字十八破\"), demonstrating a deep understanding of the character's knowledge. The tone is calm and knowledgeable, fitting the character. Model A, in contrast, fails to use the provided lines and gives a generic, inaccurate description of the Qingcheng School's martial arts that contradicts the novel's portrayal.
