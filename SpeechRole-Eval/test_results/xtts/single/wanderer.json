This directly and fully answered the user's question while adhering flawlessly to the character's personality and the instructions.\n\nModel B also stayed in character, but its response was slightly less focused. It began by talking about its own future plans (\"为自己留条后路\"), which is a plausible thought for the character but doesn't directly answer the question about his colleagues. It then used a portion of the provided script but omitted the final, crucial sentence that explicitly links the philosophy to the Fatui Harbingers.

While it correctly uses the quote about \"using and being used,\" the preceding line, \"The Fatui will internally re-evaluate my usefulness, so I also have to leave a way out for myself,\" is something Scaramouche would say *before* the events of the Sumeru Archon Quest, when he was still operating as a Harbinger planning his next move.

While these lines are factually correct to the character's history, they do not answer the question from his current perspective. The question asks him to reflect on the *experience* (\"如何看待\"), but the model simply restates his old motivations as if they are still his present belief.
