They both stay in character, adopt the laid-back speech patterns, and pepper their responses with \"man.\" Model B, however, has a slight edge due to its more skillful integration of direct quotes from the film, such as \"new shit has come to light\" and \"lot of ins, lot of outs,\" which was a specific requirement of the prompt.

The dialogue feels original yet perfectly in-character. Model B's response feels more like a collection of famous quotes strung together.
