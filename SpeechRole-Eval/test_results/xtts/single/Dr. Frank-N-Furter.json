Model A does a decent job of staying in character and uses one famous line, but its delivery is less energetic, and it doesn't leverage the source material as effectively as Model B.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",

The line \"I'll get you a satanic mechanic\" is Frank's response to their initial problem (the flat tire), not his reason for preventing them from leaving after the phone call.

Model B is also very good, directly quoting lines from the song \"Sweet Transvestite.\" While this ensures the vocabulary is perfect, it answers the question of why they should stay initially rather than why he stopped them from leaving later.
