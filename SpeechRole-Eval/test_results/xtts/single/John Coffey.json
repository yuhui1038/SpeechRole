        "reason": "Both models successfully adhered to the instructions by staying in character as John Coffey. Model A used lines that are very close to the original source material, which was encouraged by the prompt. However, the delivery sounds unnatural and pieced together, as if separate audio clips were spliced, which detracts from the immersion. Model B's response feels much more natural and conversational. While not a direct quote, it captures the essence of the character perfectly, even adding the signature term \"boss\" and expanding on the feeling in a believable way. The audio performance of Model B is significantly more fluid and convincing.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",
