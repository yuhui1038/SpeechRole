They both adopted the arrogant, high-energy tone of Jordan Belfort effectively. Model B has a slight edge because it directly reused a line from the provided character script (\"looked at me like I'd just discovered fire\"), which was a specific instruction in the prompt. Model A captured the same sentiment but paraphrased it. Model B's response was also more concise and punchy, which felt slightly more authentic to the character's narration in the film.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

Model A attempts an energetic and arrogant style, but the execution is less consistent and more stilted.
