The logic is unwavering and consistent with his character's stoicism.\n\nModel B provides a more reflective answer, acknowledging the internal conflict the revelation caused (\"it tore apart everything I thought I knew\") before reaffirming his commitment to the law. While this is also a coherent and logical progression, it feels slightly more introspective than Dredd would typically be. Model A's response, by contrast, *shows* the internal conflict by how forcefully it rejects emotion, which is a more powerful and character-consistent approach.

The voice is suitably deep, but the delivery is more conversational and less imposing than Model A's. The dialogue itself, which admits that the revelation \"tore apart everything I thought I knew,\" reveals a level of emotional vulnerability that feels slightly out of character for Dredd.

Model B, while correctly identifying that Dredd's duty comes first, presents it in a more reflective and almost vulnerable way (\"It tore apart everything I thought I knew\").
