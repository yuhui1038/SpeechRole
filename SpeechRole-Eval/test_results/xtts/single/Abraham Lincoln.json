Model A's performance was notably stronger, however, as it incorporated more specific historical context and even quoted directly from Lincoln's 1862 message to Congress. This gave its response a greater sense of authenticity and depth. Model B provided a plausible, in-character response, but its language was slightly more modern and lacked the specific historical references that made Model A's answer so convincing.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 7)",
