The stress on words feels generic, like a standard text-to-speech reading, rather than highlighting the key \"facts\" in the way the character would.\n\nModel B provides a much more convincing performance.

However, it makes a crucial error in its knowledge consistency by stating, \"He gave me a license plate number... SG137IU.\" In the film's chronology, this is incorrect. Leonard discovers Teddy's license plate number himself and chooses to use it for his next tattoo after deciding Teddy is his new target.

It immediately points to the tattoos and notes before explaining the reasoning behind them with the Sammy Jankis story. This feels more urgent and paranoid, as if Leonard is trying to prove his system works in the heat of the moment.
