It also adds further details (\"青字九打\", \"城字十八破\") that are accurate to the source material, demonstrating a deep understanding of the character's knowledge. The tone is calm and knowledgeable, fitting for Wang Yuyan.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, fails to use the provided lines. Its description of the Qingcheng Sect's martial arts (\"以柔中有刚见长\") contradicts the novel's description (\"以诡变险狠见长\"). While it attempts to capture her sorrowful mood with stage-direction-like descriptions (\"我轻轻地叹了口气\"), the core content of its answer is inaccurate and disregards the specific instructions.
