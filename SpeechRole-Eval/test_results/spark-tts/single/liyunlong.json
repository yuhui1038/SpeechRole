It starts with a very characteristic coarse dismissal (\"气个啥？\"), accepts the deserved scolding, but immediately pivots to his famous \"wolf pack\" philosophy.

It immediately establishes the character's voice with phrases like \"气个啥？\" and the iconic use of \"老子\". This captures his coarse and proud demeanor perfectly. While also acknowledging the necessity of taking the criticism (\"那就挨着呗\"), it quickly pivots to his core philosophy—the wolf analogy.

The tone of begrudging acceptance and respect for authority is spot-on.\n\nModel B also captures the essence of the character perfectly. It uses Li Yunlong's characteristic coarse language (\"老子\") and correctly links the \"发面团\" (fermented dough) criticism to his famous \"wolf pack\" philosophy.
