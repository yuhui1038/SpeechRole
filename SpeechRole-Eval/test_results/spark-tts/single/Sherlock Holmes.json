Lord Blackwood’s supposed resurrection was merely an elaborate stage play, designed to prey upon the superstitions of the credulous. There was never any magic, only conjuring tricks.\n\nThe key, my dear fellow, was in the details. The sandstone slab that covered his tomb, for instance. A simple observation revealed it had been broken *before* his burial and then pieced back together with a mild adhesive. An ancient Egyptian recipe, if my studies serve me correctly—a mixture of egg and honey, designed to be washed away by the rain or, as it happened, eaten by animals. Once the adhesive was gone, the path was clear. The rest was mere theatrics and fear-mongering to cement his villainous reputation. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Instead of being mystified, I simply gathered the facts. Elementary.Qualitative Evaluation: Both models delivered excellent, in-character responses that fully adhered to the instructions.
