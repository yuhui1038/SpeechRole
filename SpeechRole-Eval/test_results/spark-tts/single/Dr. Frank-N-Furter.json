Model B, while not using a direct quote, crafted a response with language and cadence that felt perfectly authentic to the character, calling the guests \"delectable\" and \"a canvas waiting for a master's stroke.\" Both models provided a convincing, in-character motivation for keeping Brad and Janet at the castle.
