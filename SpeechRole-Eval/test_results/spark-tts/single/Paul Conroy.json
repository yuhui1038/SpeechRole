The panicked, fragmented speech, the desperate repetition, and the out-of-breath delivery perfectly capture Paul Conroy's immediate reaction to the devastating news. It doesn't just describe the feeling; it embodies it, making for a powerful and immersive experience. Model B also stays in character but offers a more reflective, narrative answer. While the content is appropriate, the tone is calmer and more resigned, lacking the sheer terror and disbelief that defined the moment in the story.
