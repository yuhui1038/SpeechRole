The line \"钱花的越多，越踏实\" (The more money I spend, the more at ease I feel) is a brilliant way to hint at his secret mission without revealing it, sounding just like a quirk of a newly rich man. The vocabulary, such as \"豪横\" (extravagant/domineering), is spot-on.\n\nModel A's performance is also good. It correctly stays in character and even uses a direct quote from the movie as instructed. However, its justification for booking the restaurant—\"to bring everyone a fresh experience\"—sounds a bit too reasonable and considerate, slightly deviating from Wang Duoyu's more impulsive and show-off nature. Model B's reasoning feels more authentic to the character.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 10)",
