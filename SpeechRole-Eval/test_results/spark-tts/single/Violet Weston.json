Model A delivers a plausible, emotional justification for hiding the secret, capturing Violet's defensive and manipulative nature. However, Model B is superior because it directly incorporates lines and sentiments from the original play, as specifically requested in the prompt. Model B's response is more authentic to the source material, capturing Violet's specific brand of callous, matter-of-fact cruelty and her dark, practical humor (\"never know when someone might need a kidney\").\n\n[Scores]: (7, 10)",

The logic presented is exactly the twisted justification she gives in the play, making it a highly coherent and authentic response.\n\nModel A offers a more generic, psychological explanation. While the idea of \"protecting\" the family is a plausible, if twisted, motivation for a matriarch, it feels less specific to Violet's particular brand of venom. Violet's cruelty is often more direct and less concerned with others' emotional states than Model A's response suggests.

The claim \"I had to protect her, protect myself, protect this family from the truth\" is the opposite of Violet's established behavior.
