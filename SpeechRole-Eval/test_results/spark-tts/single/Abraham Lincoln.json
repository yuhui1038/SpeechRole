More importantly, it directly references the idea of a \"mandate\" from the people, which perfectly aligns with the script's context where Lincoln discusses his re-election as a public affirmation of his actions. This creates a highly coherent and continuous narrative.\n\nModel B also delivers a strong, in-character response, framing the amendment as a necessary \"weapon\" to win the war and fulfill the nation's promise. While this is a powerful and logical argument, it does not connect back to the specific context of the people's mandate from the election, which was a central point in the provided script.
