The response delved into the specific, tangible aspects of Detective Mills' life that John Doe envies—his home, his wife, and his \"blissful ignorance.\" This felt very true to the film's final act. The vocal performance was outstanding, with a slow, deliberate, and menacing calm that perfectly matched the character's on-screen presence.\n\nModel B also delivered a strong, in-character performance.
