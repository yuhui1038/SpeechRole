It immediately grounds itself in her specific background by mentioning growing up on \"Peach Blossom Island\" (桃花岛) with her \"Daddy\" (爹爹). It correctly frames her disinterest not as fear, but as a preference for more \"interesting\" pursuits like music and painting, which is perfectly in character.
