They remained fully in character for the entire duration, using a tone and vocabulary appropriate for the role.\n\nModel B followed the instruction to reuse lines from the provided script more literally in the first round, which was a strong point. However, Model A's performance was more compelling and theatrical. It captured the tortured, manic essence of Old Salieri reminiscing from the asylum, particularly with its use of dramatic pauses and pained, non-verbal vocalizations. This added a layer of emotional depth that made the portrayal feel more authentic and powerful.
