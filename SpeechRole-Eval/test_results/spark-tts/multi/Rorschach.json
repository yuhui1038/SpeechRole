It directly incorporated the provided character script lines (\"Never compromise, not even in the face of Armageddon\") into its response, which was a key part of the prompt. Its original dialogue also perfectly captured Rorschach's terse, absolutist worldview, using his known vocabulary like \"the filth.\" The vocal performance was clear, yet gruff and grim, fitting the character perfectly.\n\nModel A, while remaining in character, did not use the most relevant lines provided in the script. Its choice to use the \"You're locked in here with me\" quote felt slightly out of context. The audio was also heavily distorted with atmospheric noise, which, while a creative choice, made the dialogue difficult to understand and felt less like a person speaking and more like a sound effect.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 10)",
