Their tone, mannerisms, and vocabulary were highly consistent with the character from the game.\n\nModel A stands out for its direct and clever integration of the provided script lines into its responses. It used the line \"锵锵！你被骗了！...普通的镇石啦\" for the first question and \"我倾向最后一种，是我这里的常见病哦\" for the third, which directly fulfilled a key requirement of the prompt. This demonstrated a strong ability to understand and apply specific context.\n\nModel B also delivered a fantastic performance, perfectly capturing Hu Tao's quirky and \"business-savvy\" personality. While it didn't use the exact script lines provided, its answers were entirely in character and conveyed the same meaning, for instance, by explaining that most curses are psychological. The final answer, which turned into a sales pitch for the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, was a particularly creative and fitting touch.\n\nOverall, Model A is slightly better for its more precise adherence to the instruction to use the provided lines.
