Sure, I had a fancier rock-apron for a while, but what really matters is havin' my beautiful wife Wilma, my little girl Pebbles, and my best pal Barney. That stuff... that's what makes a guy rich.

Its prosody captures the character's boisterous, slightly gruff, and excitable nature. The pitch variation is excellent, rising with excitement for the \"Yabba dabba doo!\" and adopting a more hesitant, flustered intonation when asked about taking credit from Barney. This dynamic yet consistent portrayal feels authentic. Model B's attempt is less successful. While the voice has a low pitch, it is largely monotonous and lacks the energy and emotional range characteristic of Fred. The delivery is flat across all three questions, failing to adapt its prosody to the context, which makes the character feel lifeless and the performance inconsistent with Fred's well-known personality.
