They maintained the character of Judge Dredd perfectly throughout the three rounds, using the appropriate tone, vocabulary, and unwavering, law-focused perspective. Neither model broke character or included any out-of-character meta-commentary.\n\nModel A's performance was outstanding. It directly incorporated a line from the provided script as requested (\"I don't have anyone else to ask...\"), demonstrating a close reading of the source material. The explanations were concise, logical, and perfectly in-character, capturing Dredd's pragmatic view of his situation and his grudging respect for Hershey's integrity.\n\nModel B was also excellent. While it paraphrased the key line from the script rather than quoting it directly, its original lines were incredibly sharp and insightful. The distinction it drew between \"enforcing\" the law and \"upholding\" it was a particularly strong piece of character work that felt authentic to Dredd's developing perspective.\n\nOverall, both models were flawless in their adherence to the instructions.

In the first round, it directly acknowledges the provided script, framing the decision as a tactical necessity, which is perfectly in character. It then builds on this in the second round by logically reframing the emotional concept of \"trust\" into a more Dredd-like evaluation of \"competence\" and objective analysis. The final response provides a nuanced explanation for Hershey's unique quality—her \"perspective\"—which coherently explains why, despite having no other choice, he was \"still glad.\" The progression is logical, building from necessity to respect, all while maintaining a consistent, stoic tone.\n\nModel B's responses lack this level of coherence. While the first answer is factually correct, it is overly simplistic. The second answer immediately breaks character by embracing emotional concepts like \"trust,\" \"good person,\" and \"faith,\" which contradicts the logical, unemotional persona of Judge Dredd. This creates an internal inconsistency. The third response continues this out-of-character sentimentality by focusing on \"compassion\" and her being a \"loyal ally,\" rather than her specific capabilities as a Judge. The conversational thread is weak, as it shifts from a pragmatic reason to a series of emotional platitudes that are not consistent with the character being portrayed.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 5)",
