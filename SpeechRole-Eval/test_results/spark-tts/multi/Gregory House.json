It started by eliminating other possibilities (\"Tumors don't pack up and move\"), explained the failure of the tests using the same script context (\"it's only abnormal in about 30% of...cases\"), and finished by rejecting \"gut feeling\" in favor of logic, cleverly using a Sherlock Holmes quote appropriate for the character.\n\nBoth models were perfect in their logical consistency and ability to craft a coherent, multi-part conversation.
