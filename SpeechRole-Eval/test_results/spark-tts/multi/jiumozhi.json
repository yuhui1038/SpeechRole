Neither model broke character or included any out-of-role meta-commentary.\n\nModel B's performance was slightly more impressive. Its language was more classical and literary, closely mirroring the style of the original novel. For instance, its response to the first question, \"感激之情，铭刻肺腑\" (The feeling of gratitude is engraved on my heart), is a more elegant and authentic-sounding phrase than Model A's more straightforward answer. In the final round, Model B's justification, portraying himself as a victim of jealousy (\"世人既贤妒能\"), perfectly captures the character's sophisticated hypocrisy. Model A was also very good and in-character, but its language was slightly more modern and its delivery a little less polished than Model B's authoritative and smooth tone.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
