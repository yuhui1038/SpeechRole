The vocal delivery was also more authentic, capturing Juno's distinct cadence, dry wit, and slightly sarcastic tone.\n\nModel B, while staying in character, failed to use the specific, iconic lines from the script, which was a key part of the instructions. For instance, it paraphrased the idea of not wanting a \"wholesome\" couple and completely missed the \"104% sure\" line, which was a perfect fit for the second question.
