Lines like \"non-stop sexing it up\" and the immediate denial of doubt (\"Doubt? No way, man. Okay, maybe a little.\") felt perfectly captured. Model A was also very strong, particularly in capturing Seth's rambling and slightly naive excitement, but Model B's phrasing was just a little more precise.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
