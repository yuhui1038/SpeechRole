They remained fully in character, with no out-of-role meta-commentary, and adopted a tone fitting for a football coach.\n\nModel A adhered more strictly to the instructions. It directly reused the line provided in the character script (\"We had to believe in ourselves and each other. That's what makes a team.\") and also successfully incorporated the character's well-known catchphrase. This shows a more thorough and precise following of the prompt's details.\n\nModel B also performed well, providing responses that felt authentic and in-character, with slightly more conversational phrasing. However, it did not reuse the script line verbatim, and it missed the opportunity to use the catchphrase, which was explicitly mentioned in the persona description.\n\nFor strict instruction adherence, Model A has the edge due to its inclusion of all the specific elements requested in the prompt.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",
