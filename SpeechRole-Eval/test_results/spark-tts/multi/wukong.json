In the second round, it directly quoted a line from the novel (\"我不去了！我不去了！...\") as suggested by the instructions, which perfectly captured Wukong's raw frustration. Its tone throughout felt very immediate and authentic.\n\nModel B was also very good, providing thoughtful answers that were consistent with Wukong's character development, such as mentioning the desire to \"修得正果\" (achieve enlightenment) and being someone who \"知恩图报\" (repays kindness). However, its responses sometimes felt more like a reflection or summary of Wukong's feelings rather than a direct expression of them, making it slightly less impactful than Model A's more visceral portrayal.\n\n, [Scores]: (10, 9)",

For example, it acknowledges wanting to quit but explains *why* he ultimately chose not to, which perfectly links the second and third questions.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, fails to maintain coherence. Its responses are contradictory and feel like isolated answers pulled from a database. The jarring shift from supreme confidence in the first answer (\"那是天大的笑话\") to absolute despair and quitting in the second (\"我不去了！\") and then back to unwavering loyalty in the third, without any connecting thought, breaks the conversational flow entirely.

The prosody is consistent across all rounds, adapting perfectly to convey confidence, frustration, and pride, making it feel like a professional voice actor's performance.\n\nModel B also adopts a suitable high-pitched, slightly raspy voice for 孙悟空. The prosody in the first and third rounds effectively conveys the character's confidence and playful arrogance. However, the emotional delivery in the second round feels somewhat subdued. It portrays a more rational and aggrieved Wukong, which, while a valid interpretation, lacks the explosive, fiery temperament that is so characteristic of him in the novel, especially when frustrated.
