Its use of the line \"Jesus, Joseph and Mary\" was also a very effective and natural character detail. Model B was also very good, but its voice was a little more of a generic \"tough guy\" sound, and the inclusion of \"Get off my lawn\" felt slightly forced at the end of the response.

Model B is also quite fluent, with clear articulation.

The two answers form a single, cohesive argument rooted in Walt's personal history.\n\nModel B also provides character-consistent answers. It establishes the car's value as a classic \"American car\" and then correctly states his family wouldn't appreciate it. The logic is sound and the conversation is coherent. However, the connection is slightly less specific and personal than in Model A. The value is more general (\"American car\"), and the transition feels slightly less like a direct build-up from the first point.
