Crucially, Model A was far more adept at seamlessly integrating the provided script lines into its answers, making the responses feel powerful and true to the film's portrayal. Model B also stayed in character and used some of the script, but its delivery was less forceful, and it often paraphrased the provided lines rather than using them directly, which lessened the impact.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 7)",
