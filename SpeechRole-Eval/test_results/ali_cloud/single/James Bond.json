This level of detail makes the response feel authentic and directly tied to the specific scene from 'Tomorrow Never Dies'.\n\nModel A's response is coherent in its logic but feels generic. The language, particularly \"old chap,\" is more of a clich√© British spy archetype than the specific Bond requested.
