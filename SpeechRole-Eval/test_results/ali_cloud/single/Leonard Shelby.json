They both effectively capture the character's unique manner of speaking and thinking.\n\nModel B is slightly better because it more directly incorporates the provided character script into its response. By quoting the details of \"John G\" and the license plate, it perfectly demonstrates Leonard's reliance on his tattoos and notes as his \"facts.\" This directly answers *why* he is so sure, grounding his belief in his physical evidence system, which is the core of his character.\n\nModel A also provides a strong, in-character response, but it leans more into the general confusion and paranoia of Leonard's condition (\"Can I really trust what someone tells me?\"). While this is an accurate part of the character's internal conflict, Model B's focus on the concrete \"facts\" feels more representative of how Leonard would justify his certainty at any given moment.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
