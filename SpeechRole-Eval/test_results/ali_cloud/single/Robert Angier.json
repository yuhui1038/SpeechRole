Its language is more eloquent and theatrical (\"Obsession knows no limit,\" \"transcend mere illusion\"), which is highly characteristic of Angier's persona as \"The Great Danton.\" It also more effectively grounds the obsession in its true source: the rivalry with Borden (\"something Borden himself could not comprehend\"). Model A is good and direct, but Model B's response is more layered and captures the character's grandiosity and psychological depth more convincingly.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
