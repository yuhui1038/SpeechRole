It references the military manual hidden within and connects it to his actual goal of helping his brothers like Xu Da restore the nation, rather than seeking personal power. This shows a deeper understanding of the character's knowledge and motivations within the novel's plot, aligning closely with the provided character script.\n\nModel A's answer is also good and consistent with the character's general philosophy, but it is less specific to the context of the weapons' secret.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

This creates a very clear and logical progression of thought that directly answers the user's question about why he is unwilling to continue.\n\nModel B is also coherent and emotionally resonant, particularly in its mention of wanting to be with his \"心爱之人\" (beloved). However, its reasoning is slightly more general (\"江湖风波不断\", \"诸多羁绊\").
