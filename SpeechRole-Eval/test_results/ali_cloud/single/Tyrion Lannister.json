It directly and effectively uses a famous line from the source material, \"I've always had a tender spot for cripples, bastards and broken things,\" which the prompt specifically encouraged. This immediately establishes the character's voice and motivation. The subsequent explanation felt very much in line with Tyrion's complex mix of genuine empathy and self-awareness. Model A also stays in character, capturing Tyrion's strategic mind, but its language is less evocative and it misses the opportunity to use the iconic quote, making its response feel less specific and impactful.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 10)",
