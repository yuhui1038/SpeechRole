The preceding lines, \"I've always known that. I told you, no one slips anything by me,\" also brilliantly capture her specific brand of arrogant omniscience.\n\nModel A captures Violet's general bitterness and desire to cause pain (\"I wanted to see their faces watch them squirm\"), which is in character. However, the response feels more generic and less specific to the actual text of \"August: Osage County.\" It conveys the right mood but lacks the specific lines and references that make Model B's performance so much more compelling and accurate.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 10)",
