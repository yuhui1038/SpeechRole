The line \"She was like an angel... coming out of this open sewer\" is the specific reason Travis gives for his fascination, and Model B delivers it perfectly in character. Model A captures the general sentiment of Travis's thoughts but doesn't use the iconic lines from the source material, which was a specific instruction. Its use of the catchphrase \"You talkin' to me?\" also feels slightly forced and out of context for this particular question.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 9)",
