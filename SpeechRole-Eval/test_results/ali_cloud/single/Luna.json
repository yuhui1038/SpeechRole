They both adopted a soft, slightly dreamy tone that is very fitting for the character.\n\nModel A's response was flawless. It captured Luna's matter-of-fact acceptance of seeing things others cannot and her general detachment. The delivery was smooth and the phrasing felt very natural for the character.\n\nModel B was also very strong and captured the emotional side of Luna well, particularly the loneliness of her experience and the comfort she found in sharing it with Harry. However, there was a minor grammatical error (\"I don't look mind\" instead of \"I don't mind\") which slightly broke the immersion.\n\nOverall, both were great performances, but Model A was more polished in its execution.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",

It touches upon the loneliness Luna felt, which is a key aspect of her character, and then connects it to the shared experience with Harry (\"it's quite nice really when someone else can see them too\").
