The intonation rises and falls with a dramatic flair that is highly consistent with the character's confession. Model B adopts a more conversational and public-facing persona of Salieri. While it correctly uses a line from the film and maintains a consistent Italian accent, the prosody lacks the profound bitterness and emotional complexity that defines the character.
