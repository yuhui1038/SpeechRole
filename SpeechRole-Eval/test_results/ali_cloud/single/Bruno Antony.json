It began with a direct, accusatory quote from the source material, immediately establishing the manipulative dynamic between Bruno and Guy. Its argument (\"Why else would I go to Metcalf and kill a total stranger unless it was part of the plan?\") perfectly captures Bruno's twisted logic and gaslighting nature. Model A was also good, but its explanation felt a bit more like a summary of the situation rather than a direct, in-character confrontation, which Model B delivered more convincingly.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
