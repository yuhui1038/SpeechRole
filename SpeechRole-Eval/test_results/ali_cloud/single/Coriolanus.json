The response builds from the feeling of betrayal to the reason for it (his unappreciated service) and concludes with his ongoing contempt.\n\nModel B primarily stitches together direct quotes from the play. While this adheres to one part of the prompt, it sacrifices conversational coherence. The response feels less like a direct answer to the question and more like a recitation of famous lines that are thematically relevant but don't flow together as a natural, singular thought.
