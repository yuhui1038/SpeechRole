They remained fully in character for the duration of the interaction, without any out-of-character remarks. They both demonstrated a strong understanding of Judy's personality, her story, and her relationships, particularly with Nick Wilde.\n\nModel A felt slightly more authentic. In the first response, it perfectly integrated the iconic line, \"It's called a hustle, sweetheart,\" which perfectly captured the moment of her outsmarting Nick. Its second response was also strong, showing a reflective side that was true to Judy's character growth.\n\nModel B was also very good. It cleverly rephrased a line from the provided script (\"it's his word against his\"), which was a nice touch. Its second response, concluding with \"He made me a better bunny, and a better cop,\" was very powerful and in character. However, Model A's performance felt just a bit more natural and closer to the source material overall.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

In the first round, it flawlessly incorporates Judy's famous line, \"It's called a hustle, sweetheart,\" which establishes a strong, in-character foundation. In the second round, it directly references the disastrous press conference, a pivotal moment that forced Judy to confront her biases. This specific connection makes the progression of her changing perspective feel more grounded and coherent within the established story.

Critically, Model A adapts its prosody effectively in the second round, shifting to a more thoughtful and sincere intonation to match the reflective nature of the question, while still sounding consistently like the same character.\n\nModel B captures the high pitch and energetic pace of Judy Hopps but leans into a more generic, bubbly, and almost child-like quality. The intonation is expressive but lacks the underlying firmness and professionalism of Officer Hopps. The prosody remains largely the same across both questions—consistently upbeat and fast-paced—which feels less appropriate for the second, more serious question about personal growth.

In the second question, Model A also did a better job of conveying the emotional depth of Judy's character growth, using more reflective language like, \"I was naive.
