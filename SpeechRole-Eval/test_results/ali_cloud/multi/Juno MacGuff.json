Its responses incorporated more specific and inventive details that are characteristic of Juno's unique brand of humor, such as the references to \"a sea monkey\" and people who are \"spiritually wealthy.\" While Model A was very good and used the \"104% sure\" line effectively, Model B's language felt richer and more deeply aligned with the character's voice from the film.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
