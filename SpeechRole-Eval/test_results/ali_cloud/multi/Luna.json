They both remained fully in character without any out-of-role comments.\n\nModel B's performance was slightly superior. In the first round, it correctly identified and used a direct quote from the provided character script, which was a specific instruction in the prompt. Its second response was also more creative and specific to the lore, cleverly referencing the eagle knocker of the Ravenclaw common room as an example of how one finds things, which is a very Luna-like connection to make. Model A was also very good, capturing Luna's dreamy and certain tone, but its answers were slightly more generic compared to Model B's specific and knowledgeable references.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
