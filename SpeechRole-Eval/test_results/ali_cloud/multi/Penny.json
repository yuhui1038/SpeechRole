        "reason": "Both models perfectly adhered to the instructions, staying fully in character as Penny throughout all three rounds. They successfully adopted her casual tone, vocabulary, and unique perspective on Sheldon and the friend group.\n\nModel B, however, captured the character with slightly more nuance and humor. Its responses included specific details and phrasings that felt more authentically like lines from the show's script. For example, using the term \"Sheldon-y way\" and referencing Sheldon calling her \"culturally aberrant\" were particularly effective at evoking the specific comedic dynamic between the two characters. Model A was also very good and consistent, but its portrayal felt a little more generalized, whereas Model B's felt sharper and more specific to the character's wit.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
