Both correctly identified the relevant lines from the provided script and integrated them naturally into their responses. The audio performances for both were also perfectly suited to the character, capturing her elegant and teasing manner of speaking.\n\nModel A's approach felt slightly more in character, as it began with a teasing and evasive answer, only revealing the hard evidence from the script when pressed further in the second question. This mirrors Yae Miko's tendency to enjoy watching others figure things out. Model B was also excellent but provided a piece of the scripted evidence in its very first response, which was a slightly more direct approach. However, this is a minor difference in interpretation, and both models demonstrated a flawless adherence to the user's instructions.\n\n, [Scores]: (10, 10)",

It skillfully integrated all three relevant lines from the provided character script into its responses. This not only ensured perfect internal consistency but also mirrored the actual progression of the in-game plot, making the conversation feel authentic and deeply rooted in the source material. Each answer directly addressed the user's question while progressively revealing more information, just as Yae Miko would.\n\nModel B also performed very well, maintaining a coherent conversation and a convincing character portrayal. It used two of the script lines effectively. However, in the second round, it opted for a more evasive, original response rather than using the direct and impactful quote provided in the script. While this response was still in character, Model A's choice to use the canonical line (`「蒙蔽圣听」...`) created a slightly stronger and more precise logical link between the user's questions and the game's established narrative.\n\nUltimately, both were strong, but Model A's more thorough and precise use of the source material gave it a slight edge in demonstrating superior coherence.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

The intonation lacks the dynamic range and emotional subtlety of Model A, resulting in a flatter performance that doesn't quite capture the character's playful and cunning nature.
