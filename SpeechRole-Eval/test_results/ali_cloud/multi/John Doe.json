Both successfully incorporate a key line from the character's dialogue and answer from Doe's twisted ideological standpoint without any out-of-character meta-commentary. Model A has a slight edge due to its more direct and cutting language, which feels marginally more authentic to the character's unshakeable and accusatory self-righteousness, particularly in its final answer.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
