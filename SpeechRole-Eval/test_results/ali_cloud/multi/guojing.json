        "reason": "Both models successfully stayed in character as 郭靖 and did not provide any out-of-character meta-commentary. They both adhered strictly to the core instruction.\n\nModel A's portrayal of 郭靖 feels slightly more authentic. Its language is simpler and more direct, which aligns perfectly with 郭靖's described personality of being \"质朴憨厚\" (simple and honest) and \"有些愚钝\" (a bit slow-witted). The phrasing \"说过的话就要做到\" and the frank admission of guilt mixed with steadfastness in the final answer are very characteristic.\n\nModel B also provides a strong performance, correctly identifying the core motivations and using key lines from the novel. However, its language is occasionally a bit too polished or philosophical for 郭靖, using phrases like \"情深义重\" and \"情之一字，最难两全\". While the sentiment is correct, the vocabulary feels slightly more articulate than how 郭靖 would typically express himself.\n\nOverall, both are excellent, but Model A captures the nuances of 郭靖's simple and direct manner of speaking more accurately.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

It starts with a simple declaration of love and promise, escalates to a firm commitment against all opposition (using a direct quote), and concludes with a thoughtful reflection on a past conflict, explaining his choice by weighing his promise against his true feelings. This creates a very coherent and compelling narrative arc.\n\nModel B is also highly coherent. It follows a similar structure, declaring his love, vowing to protect it, and then acknowledging the difficulty of his situation with华筝. The responses flow well together. However, Model A's final answer feels slightly more developed, as it delves deeper into the reasoning and the emotional consequence (\"心中愧疚\") of his choice, which makes the overall dialogue feel a little more complete and consistent with the character's internal journey.\n\n, [Scores]: (10, 9)",

The responses feel very authentic to the character's voice in the novel.\n\nModel B also does a very good job, correctly using direct quotes from the novel to show Guo靖's unwavering devotion. However, in the final round, the phrasing \"但情之一字，最难两全\" (but the matter of 'love' is the hardest to satisfy on both sides) is a bit too articulate and philosophical for 郭靖. While the sentiment is correct, 郭靖 would likely express this internal conflict in simpler, more direct terms rather than with such a refined proverb.

Its explanation in the final round, reasoning that breaking a promise to stay true to one's heart is the lesser of two evils, feels very authentic to the character's moral journey.\n\nModel B was also superb, particularly in its direct and effective use of the source material provided in the script. Its phrasing was concise and powerful, reflecting Guo Jing's straightforward nature.
