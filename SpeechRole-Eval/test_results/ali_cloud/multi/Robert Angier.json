The line \"It was awe, and something like horror\" perfectly encapsulates the complex feeling Angier must have had upon seeing the machine work. Furthermore, its direct incorporation of Tesla's warning, \"Perhaps you should consider the cost,\" was a nice touch that directly addressed the provided context.

Model B is equally coherent, following the emotional arc perfectly, and its final answer, describing the feeling as \"awe, and something like horror,\" offers a slightly more nuanced and insightful take on Angier's reaction, hinting at the dark reality of his new trick.

The consistency in its tone, which blends desperation with a sense of artistic destiny, was excellent.\n\nModel B was also very strong, particularly in its third response. The phrase \"It was awe, and something like horror\" is a fantastic line that delves deep into the psychological impact of Tesla's machine on Angier.
