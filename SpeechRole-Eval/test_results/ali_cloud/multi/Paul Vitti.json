They both fully embodied the character of Paul Vitti, using his distinct vocabulary, tone, and belligerent yet vulnerable attitude. The responses were direct answers from the character's perspective, with no out-of-character meta-commentary. Both models effectively captured the mob boss's disdain for therapy and a conventional life, creating authentic and entertaining responses that felt true to the source material.
