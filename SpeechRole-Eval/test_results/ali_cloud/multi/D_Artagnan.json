In contrast, Model A's performance is severely compromised by repeated, nonsensical artifacts like \"Pacer,\" \"Ticipate,\" and \"Pescipe.\" These words completely break the immersion and violate the core instruction to remain fully in character, making the response feel like a corrupted file rather than a genuine role-playing attempt.\n\n[Scores]: (2, 10)",

Model A is logically consistent in that its answers follow the questions, but it suffers from a jarring and inexplicable opening line (\"My name is D'Artagnan, not Dr. Tagman\") and strange textual artifacts that disrupt the flow and make the conversation feel disjointed and unnatural.
