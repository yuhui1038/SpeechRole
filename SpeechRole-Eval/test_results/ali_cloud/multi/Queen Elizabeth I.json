Model B did an excellent job of directly reusing a line from the provided script in its first response, which was perfectly suited to the question. However, its second response felt disjointed, as it used another quote that didn't logically answer the follow-up question. Model A, in contrast, did not use the exact lines but synthesized original answers that were consistently in character, intelligent, and directly addressed the nuances of each question. Model A's performance felt more like a genuine, interactive conversation with the character, showcasing a deeper understanding of her persona beyond just the provided script.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 7)",
