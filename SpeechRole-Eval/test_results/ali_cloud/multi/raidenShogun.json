They remained fully in character, adhering strictly to the persona without any out-of-character remarks. Both successfully integrated lines from the provided script into their responses.\n\nModel A's performance felt more aligned with the Raiden Shogun puppet—stoic, direct, and matter-of-fact. Its answers were concise and relied heavily on the script, which was very effective.\n\nModel B's performance felt more like it was channeling Raiden Ei, the person behind the puppet. The responses were slightly more emotional and elaborative, adding lines that showed a deeper understanding of the character's personal grief and motivations for pursuing eternity. This added a layer of depth to the portrayal.\n\nBoth interpretations are valid given the character's nature, but Model B's willingness to expand upon the script with such fitting and insightful lines gave it a slight edge in overall quality.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

Crucially, this specific prosodic style is maintained with perfect consistency across all three responses, even when discussing deeply personal and painful topics. This unwavering delivery strengthens the characterization.\n\nModel B also delivers a strong performance with an appropriate low pitch and serious tone. However, its prosody shows slightly more emotional variation. In the second response, when talking about Kitsune Saiguu, there is a more noticeable hint of sadness and regret in the intonation. While this is a valid and believable interpretation of the character, it makes the overall prosody slightly less uniform compared to Model A's rigidly consistent delivery.

Model A, in stark contrast, is emotionally flat and robotic.
