Model A is slightly more effective due to its more precise and contextually accurate use of the original lines from the novel/film, directly quoting the famous \"On the record... Off the record...\" speech in response to the specific question about the memo, just as it happens in the source material. Model B also uses the line, but in response to the first question, which is less accurate to the original scene's context. Both models successfully embody the character's arrogance and authority.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
