They maintained the persona throughout, with no out-of-role meta-commentary. Model B, however, demonstrated a superior adherence to the prompt's finer details by directly referencing and paraphrasing lines from the provided character script (\"It was the winter of 1788...\", \"near tears\", \"it's only your body that dies\"). This specific use of the source material, as requested, made its performance more authentic and contextually accurate. Model A captured the general tone well, but its responses were more generic, whereas Model B's felt more grounded in the specific scene provided.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

In its first answer, it states Lestat was chosen for his \"fearlessness,\" but in the second, it describes him as weak and \"near tears.\" While not a major break in logic, this small inconsistency makes its dialogue slightly less coherent than Model A's well-integrated answers.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 7)",
