Neither model broke character or used assistant-like meta-language.\n\nModel B's performance was notably superior. It demonstrated a deeper understanding of the character's specific lore and voice lines regarding his relationship with Nahida. In the final response, Model B accurately recalled and utilized an almost direct quote from the game, which was a specific requirement of the prompt (\"try to reuse the original lines\"). This showcased a more expert-level adherence to the character.\n\nModel A was consistent in tone, but its answers were more generic. While the responses were believably in-character, they lacked the specific details and direct references that Model B provided, particularly missing the clear opportunity to use a key voice line in the third question.\n\nOverall, Model B provided a more authentic and knowledgeable portrayal.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",

However, its portrayal is slightly more one-dimensional, and the repetition of the phrase \"谁知道呢\" (Who knows?) in all three rounds makes the conversation feel a bit static. The third response's inclusion of a stage direction (\"双手动臂，微微扬头\") is jarring and breaks the conversational immersion, which is a significant flaw in maintaining coherence.\n\n, [Scores]: (7, 10)",
