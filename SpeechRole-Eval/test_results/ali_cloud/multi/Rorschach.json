Model B's performance, however, was significantly more convincing. Its vocal delivery captured the harsh, clipped, and gravelly tone of the character far more accurately than Model A. Model A's voice was deep and serious, but it felt more like a generic noir detective. Model B sounded specifically like Rorschach, making its adherence to the role-playing instruction superior., [Scores]: (7, 10)",

However, Model B's performance was superior due to its more natural and dynamic delivery. Model A's pacing was very even and somewhat monotonous, which made it sound slightly robotic. Model B, in contrast, used more varied pacing and inflection, which added a layer of conviction and realism to the character's voice, making its speech feel more authentically fluent and less like a text-to-speech reading.

They each established Rorschach's unyielding worldview in the first response and then logically applied that same worldview to the more extreme scenario presented in the second question.\n\nModel A's responses flow perfectly. The first answer sets up the black-and-white morality, and the second response directly confronts the \"Armageddon\" scenario by using Rorschach's most famous line about that very situation. This creates a powerful and consistent narrative thread.\n\nModel B is also highly coherent. It establishes the \"filthy word\" of compromise and then, in the second response, doubles down by rejecting the \"monstrous lie\" of the new peace, even at the cost of his own life. The logic is sound and perfectly in character.\n\nWhile both are excellent, Model A has a slight edge because its use of the \"Never. Not even in the face of Armageddon\" line is a direct and perfect rebuttal to the second question, making the coherence feel exceptionally strong and impactful.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

The voice is deep but lacks the signature gravel and rasp. Its prosody is smoother and has more melodic variation than one would expect from the character, sounding more like a generic dramatic narrator than the disturbed and guttural vigilante.

This captures the character's disturbed and unwavering nature flawlessly.\n\nModel B, while having a deep voice, felt more like a generic \"tough guy\" or an action hero. The emotional tone was centered on anger and frustration, which is a less nuanced interpretation of the character. Rorschach's intensity comes from a cold, absolute certainty, not a hot temper.

In the second round, it uses key phrases from Rorschach's final confrontation, such as \"Evil must be punished\" and \"lived my life free of compromise,\" which makes the response feel incredibly authentic and grounded in the source material.\n\nModel B is also excellent, generating original dialogue that is highly consistent with Rorschach's character. Lines like \"Compromise is the grease that lets the wheels of this corrupt world turn\" are brilliant and sound like they could have come directly from the novel.
