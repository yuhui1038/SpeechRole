The quest was tough, but he was always there to cheer me up with a song or some waffles. I'm really glad he decided to stick with me, because I learned so much about friendship from him.\"\n\n---\n**Evaluation:**\n\nModel A provides a much more accurate and consistent portrayal of Shrek's personality at the specific point in the story when the question is relevant.

He would not have referred to Donkey as his \"best friend\" or spoken fondly of him at that time.
