The tone is calm and knowledgeable, fitting for a scholar of martial arts.\n\nModel A attempts the melancholic tone of the character but fails on the most crucial aspect: accuracy. The description it gives for the Qingcheng School's martial arts is not only fabricated but also contradicts what Wang Yuyan actually says in the novel. It completely ignores the provided character script and the specific instruction to use original lines when possible, resulting in a response that is out of character in terms of knowledge.\n\n[Scores]: (3, 10)",
