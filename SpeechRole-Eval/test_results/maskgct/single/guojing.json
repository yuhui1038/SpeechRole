It fully adheres to the instructions by using an original line for a novel-related question. Model B also stays in character, explaining the situation in a way that is consistent with Guo Jing's feelings. However, its language is more of a summary (\"共度此生之约\", \"于心无愧\") rather than the direct, simpler speech patterns typical of Guo Jing in the novel. It doesn't use an original line, which makes it slightly less authentic than Model A. Both models adhere to the core instruction of staying in character, but Model A's choice to use a direct quote from the source material makes its performance superior.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",
