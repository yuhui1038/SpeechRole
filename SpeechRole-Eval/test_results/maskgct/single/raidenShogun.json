It directly incorporates phrases from the provided character script (\"土地被漆黑的浓雾笼罩，魔物横行\") and uses slightly more evocative and melancholic language (\"不堪回首的记忆,\" \"眼见挚友与亲眷在灾祸中离去\") which is very appropriate for a question about inner feelings regarding past trauma. It also mentions more specific lore details like severing ties with Celestia and creating the Plane of Euthymia, making the answer feel more comprehensive.\n\nModel B is also exceptional. It has a slightly firmer, more resolute tone (\"哼,\" \"我的意志都未曾动摇\") and its summary of her decision (\"舍弃『我』，成就『规则』\") is incredibly sharp and fitting.

Phrasing like \"我愿化身寂静，背负一切\" (I will become stillness, and bear everything) perfectly encapsulates her decision to suppress her own grief and transform it into an unwavering Archon's duty.

While this is the core truth of her experience, Ei typically presents her motivations in a more resolved and less overtly emotional manner.
