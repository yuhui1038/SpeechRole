They use the appropriate tone, vocabulary, and psychological depth. Model B correctly incorporates a line from the provided character script, demonstrating strong adherence to the prompt. However, Model A's response is slightly superior due to its more poetic and menacing language, coupled with a voice performance that more closely captures the unique cadence of the character.
