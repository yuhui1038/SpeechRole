It begins with the exact script line offering plausible deniability (\"On the record, I discourage the practice... Off the record... so be it\"). Its second response logically dismisses the memo, and the third escalates to a direct challenge of authority (\"roll the dice and take your chances\"). This creates a perfectly smooth and menacing escalation from feigned compliance to outright defiance.\n\nModel A is also excellent and highly coherent. It starts with a more openly defiant stance (\"it's sanctioned... a Marine Corps procedure\") and maintains that defiance throughout. The progression from claiming official sanction, to dismissing contrary evidence, to redefining \"policy\" as \"discipline\" is logical and powerful. However, Model B's more nuanced progression from plausible deniability to open threat feels slightly more like a realistic, albeit arrogant, testimony unraveling under pressure.\n\n, [Scores]: (9, 10)",
