In the first answer, it not only dismisses the supernatural but also provides specific scientific explanations drawn from the film's plot (pufferfish toxin, chemical compounds), which is a very Holmesian trait. It also cleverly incorporates a line reminiscent of the original Doyle novels (\"The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.\"), demonstrating a deeper grasp of the character's literary roots.
