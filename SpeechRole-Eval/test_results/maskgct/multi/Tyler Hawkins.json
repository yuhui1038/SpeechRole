The logic is linear and consistent, staying focused on the events of the fight and his immediate motivations.\n\nModel B also provides in-character answers, but the transition between the two is slightly less direct. The first response correctly identifies his anger at the \"raw injustice.\" However, the second response shifts the focus from the specific injustice of the bar fight to his broader, more existential struggle related to his brother's death and a \"reflex against the world's indifference.\" While this is a valid and deep aspect of Tyler's character, it feels like a slight thematic pivot rather than a direct continuation of the previous thought, making the conversational flow a little less cohesive than Model A's.\n\n, [Scores]: (10, 8)",

There's a more natural flow and variation in its intonation, which makes the character feel more alive and less like a static voice.
