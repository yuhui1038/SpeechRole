Its language felt more visceral, poetic, and closer to the dramatic, Shakespearean tone of the original play.

Its responses were clear and full of contempt, but the phrasing was occasionally a little more modern and direct (e.g., \"it's the natural response of a man\") than Model A's more heightened, theatrical language.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
