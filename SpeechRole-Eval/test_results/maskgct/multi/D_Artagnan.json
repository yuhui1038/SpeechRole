Model A, while staying in character, delivers a performance that is overly dramatic to the point of being chaotic and difficult to understand. The sentences are often fragmented and the delivery is so panicked that the core of the answer is lost. Model B feels like D'Artagnan recounting his past, whereas Model A sounds like D'Artagnan currently having a breakdown.\n\n[Scores]: (3, 10)",
