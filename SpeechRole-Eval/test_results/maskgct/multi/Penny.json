Its responses felt natural and consistent with the character from the show.\n\nModel A was less consistent. Its first response was particularly weak, with some phrasing that felt unnatural for the character (\"human reversion dictionary\") and parts that were difficult to understand. While its second and third answers were better and more in character, they lacked the nuance and specific details that made Model B's performance stand out. The audio for Model A was also inconsistent and contained distracting background noise in the first round.\n\n, [Scores]: (6, 10)",
