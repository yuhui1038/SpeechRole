The answers feel authentic to the situations, blending the shame of his actions with the sheer terror of his predicament.\n\nModel B, while staying in character, offers a much more subdued and less accurate portrayal. The voice lacks the signature energy of Fletcher Reede, sounding more contemplative and hesitant. The responses don't quite capture the comedic panic of the film; for example, the first answer sounds like a bad liar trying to cover up the truth rather than someone magically compelled to blurt it out.

The second response, a direct quote from the film, shows him after the curse has begun, honestly explaining why he must go to court. The final response reflects on the cause of this change—the wish—and his subsequent character growth. This progression is flawlessly coherent.\n\nModel B is also coherent but slightly less precise in its narrative. Its second answer is more of a vague, dramatic description of the curse's effect rather than a concrete reason why he couldn't see Max after work.
