They both maintained the role throughout the three rounds of questioning.\n\n**Qualitative Evaluation:**\nModel B's performance was vastly superior to Model A's. Model B demonstrated a deep and nuanced understanding of Zhao Min's character. Its responses were intelligent, politically motivated, and reflected her status as a Mongolian princess (\"本郡主,\" \"归顺于我朝\"). It even skillfully referenced a line from the provided character script (\"倒是我对武当诸侠，没半分礼数不周\"), showing it could integrate context effectively. The tone was a perfect blend of authority, cunning, and a hint of playful defiance, which is quintessentially Zhao Min.\n\nModel A, in contrast, presented a very shallow and generic \"villain\" persona. The language was simplistic and repetitive (\"我要让他们知道\"), and the motivation given (\"报仇雪恨\") was inaccurate to the character's complex political goals. The portrayal lacked the intelligence, wit, and strategic depth that define Zhao Min, coming across more as a common antagonist than a brilliant princess.\n\n, [Scores]: (3, 10)",

This progression is logical and reveals the character's intelligence and pragmatism.\n\nModel A, in contrast, struggles with coherence. Its first response contains a logical contradiction, claiming to act for revenge and to show Wudang's strength while simultaneously being their captor.

Her power lies in her intellect and control. Model A's delivery feels one-dimensional and lacks the subtlety and intelligence that are central to a character.
