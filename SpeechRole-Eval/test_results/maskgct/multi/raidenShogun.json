It used the provided script as a foundation but skillfully expanded upon it with new, original dialogue that was perfectly in character. For example, it added personal reflections like \"我没能见她最后一面\" (I couldn't see her one last time) and connected the past tragedy to her core motivation with \"但稻妻的未来，不该永远停留在痛苦里\" (But Inazuma's future should not remain in pain forever). This created a fluent, evolving conversation.\n\nModel A, while also staying in character, was far too repetitive. It reused the exact same opening sentence in all three rounds, making the interaction feel robotic and unnatural. It simply retrieved relevant lines from the script without synthesizing them into a coherent conversation, which resulted in a much stiffer and less believable performance compared to Model B.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",
