The delivery is confident and punchy, and it masterfully integrates lines and concepts from the source material while also adding its own authentic-sounding sales philosophy (\"Every sale starts when they tell you no, not yes\"). It remains perfectly in character and coherent throughout.\n\nModel A attempts to capture the character's energy but is severely hampered by a significant flaw in its first response. The underlying text for the first answer is largely nonsensical and reads like a poor machine translation, making the speech difficult to follow despite the fast-talking delivery. While it stays in character, the incoherence is a major failure. Its second response is much better, primarily because it sticks very closely to the provided script, but the overall performance is marred by the inconsistency and the failure of the first round.\n\n[Scores]: (4, 10)",
