They both stayed entirely in character throughout all three rounds, using a tone and vocabulary that are fitting for the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's director.\n\nModel B has a slight edge because it masterfully integrated the exact lines provided in the character script into its first two answers. This demonstrates a superior ability to follow the specific instruction to \"try to reuse the original lines from the novel\" (or in this case, the provided script). Its responses feel like they were pulled directly from the game, perfectly capturing Hu Tao's playful and prankster-like nature.\n\nModel A also provided a very strong, in-character performance. Its answers were creative and captured Hu Tao's unique philosophy on life, death, and fear. While it didn't use the provided lines verbatim, its original dialogue was still highly believable and consistent with the character.\n\nOverall, both are top-tier responses, but Model B's adherence to the specific instruction regarding source material makes it the better of the two.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

Its narrative was consistent, centering on the idea that the user was simply scaring themselves. The final response was a little less smooth, as it included the line \"No need for thanks\" when the user hadn't offered any, which slightly broke the conversational flow.
