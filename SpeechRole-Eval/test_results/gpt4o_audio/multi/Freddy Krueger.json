They stayed entirely in character, adopting the persona's sadistic, arrogant tone and vocabulary without any out-of-role commentary. Model B's performance felt slightly more authentic to the cinematic version of the character, using more concise, insult-heavy dialogue (\"meat slab,\" \"bitch\") that perfectly captured Freddy's crass and menacing nature. Model A was also fantastic but delivered slightly more descriptive and analytical responses, which, while still in character, were a little less punchy than Model B's.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
