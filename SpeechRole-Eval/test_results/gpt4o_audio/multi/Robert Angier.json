Its use of a direct quote from the film (\"perhaps you should consider the cost\") was a nice touch that grounded the response in the source material. However, a minor grammatical awkwardness in the first response (\"they laid with Tesla\") slightly detracted from an otherwise great performance.\n\nOverall, both models were highly successful, but Model A had a slight edge in its consistent and sophisticated portrayal of Angier's complex personality.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
