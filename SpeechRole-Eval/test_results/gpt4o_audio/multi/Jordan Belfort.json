They both adopted a confident, arrogant, and sales-focused persona.\n\nModel B, however, demonstrated superior instruction adherence by explicitly following the sub-instruction to \"reuse the original lines.\" In its first answer, it perfectly integrated the lines \"Give me them young, hungry and stupid...\" and \"We will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent...\" from the provided script. Model A captured the *spirit* of these lines but didn't use the direct quotes. Furthermore, Model B's use of colloquialisms and profanity (\"pal,\" \"jerk offs\") felt more authentic to the character's voice in the film. While Model A was very good, Model B was exceptional in its precision and authenticity.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
