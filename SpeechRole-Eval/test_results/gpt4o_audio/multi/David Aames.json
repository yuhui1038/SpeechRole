Model B's performance was slightly more convincing, capturing the character's cynical, detached, and slightly poetic way of speaking. Its reference to \"Monet-like skies\" was a particularly strong choice, directly alluding to the film's visuals and David's dialogue, which perfectly followed the instruction to use original lines where possible. Model A was also very good and stayed in character, but its language was slightly more straightforward and less distinctive than Model B's.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
