The responses feel like an authentic extension of the character, exploring the internal logic behind her actions.\n\nModel B, however, more directly adheres to the instruction to \"try to reuse the original lines from the novel.\" It skillfully weaves lines and concepts from the provided script (\"Beverly tore himself up over it,\" \"lived too hard, rose too high,\" \"did it all for you\") into its answers. This direct use of source material, combined with a perfectly captured manipulative and self-pitying tone, makes its performance slightly more impressive in its fulfillment of all aspects of the prompt.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",

The two parts feel like a single, developing thought process. Model B is less coherent. While the individual responses capture aspects of Violet, the connection between them is weaker. The first response claims control (\"I kept that secret where it belonged\"), but the second response pivots abruptly to Beverly's pain and then deflects to a general complaint about her sacrifices for her children.

Model B's performance is highly inconsistent. Its second response is excellent, correctly using direct quotes to showcase Violet's deflection and martyrdom complex.
