The way it spun his lies as \"rearranging the facts\" and created variations on the catchphrase (\"No one plots like Gaston\") was particularly effective. Model B was also excellent, delivering a more blunt and brutish version of the character that was equally convincing. It did a great job of incorporating the provided script lines, as requested.
