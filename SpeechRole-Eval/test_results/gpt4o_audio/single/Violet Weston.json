The explanation about timing, cruelty, and truth having a mind of its own is psychologically consistent with the character.\n\nModel B starts strong by quoting a line from the play but then devolves into a non-sequitur. The jump from revealing a life-altering secret about incest to a flippant joke about needing a kidney is an abrupt and illogical topic shift. It undermines the gravity of the situation and breaks the conversational coherence entirely, feeling more like a poorly executed attempt at dark humor than a genuine response from the character.

The voice is smooth and the intonation is more explanatory and thoughtful than acerbic. It lacks the bite, the strain, and the regional accent associated with Violet.

Model B's performance captures Violet's smugness and uses direct lines from the play, but the vocal quality is higher-pitched and the emotional delivery feels more like general snarkiness rather than the profound, venomous pain that defines Violet.
