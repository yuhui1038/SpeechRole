The selected quotes logically build upon one another to form a complete and powerful answer.\n\nModel A also provides a very strong, coherent response. It crafts an original monologue that is entirely consistent with Coriolanus's prideful and disdainful nature. The argument flows logically from his contempt for the \"common rabble\" to his belief that his deeds alone should be his qualification. While it does not use direct quotes, it creates a response that feels authentic and conversationally smooth.\n\nBoth are highly coherent.
