They successfully capture his grim, absolutist worldview and clipped, declarative speaking style. Both also incorporate the key phrase \"Justice matters\" from the provided reference script. Model B, however, feels slightly more authentic by also weaving in another iconic Rorschach quote (\"No compromise, even in the face of Armageddon\"), demonstrating a more thorough command of the source material. The vocal delivery of Model B is also marginally more effective, with a gravelly, staccato rhythm that feels very true to the character.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
