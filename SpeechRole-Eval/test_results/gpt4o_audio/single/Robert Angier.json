They both understand the core motivation behind acquiring Tesla's machine: the all-consuming rivalry with Borden.\n\nModel B has a slight edge. It more directly follows the instructions by lifting a line almost verbatim from the provided character script: \"If you understand obsession, then you know you won't change my mind.\" This demonstrates a closer adherence to the prompt's specific request to use original lines. Additionally, its explicit mention of \"Borden himself\" makes the rivalry feel more personal and pointed, which is very true to Angier's character. Model A is also excellent, but its phrasing is more of a paraphrase than a direct quote.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
