Its explanation that the mask amplifies what's already inside a person is also a more nuanced and accurate reflection of the movie's plot.

Model B also conveys a sense of responsibility, which is accurate, but its statement, \"I never would've imagined the mask could make someone worse,\" feels slightly inconsistent. By that point, Stanley understood the mask's power to unleash repressed desires and knew Dorian was a bad person, so he should have been able to connect those dots.
