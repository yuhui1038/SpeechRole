The response builds a logical progression from philosophy to action to outcome. Model B is also strong in tone, but its answer is more philosophical and less of a direct explanation. It restates her goal (paraphrasing the provided script) rather than detailing the method, and the final sentence shifts the focus from the process of control to the future distribution of power, making it slightly less coherent as a direct answer.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 8)",
