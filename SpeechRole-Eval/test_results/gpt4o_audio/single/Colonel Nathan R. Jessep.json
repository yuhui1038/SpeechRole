Model B crafts a response that paraphrases Jessep's ideology and applies it more directly to the situation regarding Santiago. While this is also coherent and in character, the phrasing \"We are clear, crystal\" feels slightly unnatural, as Jessep would demand confirmation rather than provide it himself.
