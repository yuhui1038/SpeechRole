They both avoid any assistant-like meta-commentary and speak from the character's perspective. Model B follows the instruction to use the provided character script more literally, beginning its response with direct quotes. Model A, while not using the exact lines, provides a more nuanced and philosophically rich response that feels more authentic to the character's rambling, introspective nature. Its language and tone capture the spirit of Caden Cotard's despair and artistic obsession more effectively, resulting in a more convincing and higher-quality performance.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

Model A gives a more philosophical and articulate explanation of how his condition affected his approach, discussing the tension between urgency and futility, which feels deeply authentic. Model B is also excellent, effectively using direct lines from the script as instructed, and correctly stating that his personal decay \"seeps into the work.\" Model A's response feels slightly more comprehensive in its analysis of the character's internal logic, making it marginally stronger in its coherence as a complete thought.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
