They stayed fully in character without any meta-commentary.\n\nModel B's response felt slightly more authentic to the character's experience. By mentioning that it was \"a bit lonely at first,\" it tapped into a core aspect of Luna's character—her isolation due to her unique perspective—and how finding someone else (like Harry) who shared that perspective was a relief. This added a layer of emotional depth that felt very true to the character from the books. Model A was also very good, but its answer was a bit more general and philosophical, whereas Model B's felt more personal and specific to the question.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
