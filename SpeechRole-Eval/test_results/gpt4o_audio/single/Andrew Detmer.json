Model B's response felt slightly more authentic and specific to the character. It directly quoted lines from the provided script (\"It's just my thing right now,\" \"Maybe I want a barrier\") and, more importantly, it grounded Andrew's motivation in a specific and crucial part of his backstory by mentioning his need for \"proof, evidence, especially with my dad.\" This added a layer of depth that was very true to the character's arc. Model A also did a good job of capturing Andrew's defensive and withdrawn nature, but its explanation was slightly more generic.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 10)",
