A response with strong conversational coherence would need to:\n\n1.  **Directly Address the Question:** The core of the answer must explain the *purpose* of the marriage to Candy.\n2.  **Align with the Character Script:** The script explicitly shows Lucifer thanking Candy for helping him \"peek inside [his] mother's scheming head.\" A coherent response must incorporate this fact, explaining that the marriage was a ruse designed to manipulate or get information from his mother, the Goddess.\n3.  **Incorporate Broader Series Lore:** For maximum coherence with the character's full story, a top-tier response would also mention the other key reason: to create distance from Detective Decker. After a moment of extreme vulnerability with her, Lucifer fled to Las Vegas and concocted the \"marriage\" as a defense mechanism to push her away, fearing his father's manipulation of their relationship.\n4.  **Maintain Internal Logic:** The explanation must be consistent. Claiming the marriage was for genuine love or had nothing to do with his mother would be a direct contradiction of the provided script and the show's canon, thus demonstrating poor coherence.\n\nWithout the actual text from the models, a quantitative score cannot be assigned.\n\n{Qualitative Evaluation}, [Scores]: (0, 0)",

His two-week absence was a period of sullenly giving her space while wrestling with profound rejection.\n\nA coherent response would capture this vulnerability, likely concealed beneath his typical layers of sarcastic bravado, deflection, and charm. He would not simply admit to being heartbroken. Instead, he might make a grand, dismissive statement about needing solitude or attending to some \"devilish\" personal matter, but the underlying reason—his pain over the Detective's reaction—should be palpable.
