They both successfully incorporated his famous line about having a \"tender spot\" for \"cripples, bastards and broken things.\" Model A's response was slightly more comprehensive, weaving in the political context of the Stark-Lannister relationship and a plausible sense of guilt, which made the answer feel more detailed and specific to the situation. Model B was more concise and philosophical, focusing entirely on Tyrion's personal empathy, which was also perfectly in character. Both performances were strong and convincing.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
