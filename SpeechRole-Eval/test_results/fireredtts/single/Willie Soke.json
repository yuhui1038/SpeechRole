It cleverly reuses the \"North Pole\" excuse, which is his cover story, and then gives the practical, criminal-minded reason: the house is an easy, safe place to crash. Model A's response is less coherent because it makes Willie sound too sentimental and self-aware. While he does develop a soft spot for the kid, he wouldn't articulate it by saying \"the kid's got a good heart\" as his primary reason. His motivations are driven by desperation and opportunism, which Model B captures perfectly, making its reasoning far more consistent and logical for the character. [Scores]: (6, 10)",
