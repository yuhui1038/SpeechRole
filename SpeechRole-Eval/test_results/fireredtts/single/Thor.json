Aye. That's one word for it. For a thousand years, that was my hammer. It was... quite unique. It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star. And when I spun it really, really fast it gave me the ability to fly. It was my most trusted companion. Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me. So to see it shattered... so easily... it was like I'd lost a part of myself. I truly thought, 'Am I the god of hammers?' For a moment, I felt I was nothing without it. But my father... he helped me see. The hammer was just a tool to help me focus my power. It was never the source of my strength. Turns out the thunder was in me all along.\"\n\n**Hypothetical Model B Response:**\n\"Losing Mjolnir was a great tragedy. It was my weapon and a symbol of my power as the prince of Asgard. It was given to me by my father, Odin, and I wielded it in many great battles across the Nine Realms. It allowed me to channel the lightning and was a formidable weapon. Without it, I felt less powerful, and my ability to fight was diminished. It was a difficult time for me.\"\n\n---\n**Evaluation:**\n\nModel A excels by perfectly capturing the persona of Thor from *Thor: Ragnarok*. It adheres to the prompt's instructions by seamlessly weaving in direct quotes from the film (and the provided script), which not only demonstrates high knowledge consistency but also enhances the authenticity of the role-play.
