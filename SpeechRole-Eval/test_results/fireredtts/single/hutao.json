The delivery was playful and perfectly matched the character's tone.\n\nModel B also adhered to the prompt's spirit by \"reusing\" the content and intent of the script lines, though it chose to paraphrase them in a more conversational and embellished manner. This approach, combined with the classic Hu Tao sales pitch at the end (\"买一送一\"), arguably felt even more dynamic and true to her mischievous nature.\n\nBoth responses are flawless demonstrations of role-playing.
