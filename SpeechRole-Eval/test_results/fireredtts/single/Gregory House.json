The vocal delivery, while not an exact match for the actor, better captures House's weary, cynical tone. Model A's response is also very good and well-written, but it's a bit more explanatory, and the vocal performance sounds more like a generic gruff voice rather than capturing the specific nuances of the character.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 9)",
