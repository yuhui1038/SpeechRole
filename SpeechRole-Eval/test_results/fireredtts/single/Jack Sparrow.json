It sounds more like a landlubber reading from a script he's never seen, rather than the natural, rum-soaked rhythm of a seasoned captain. The stress on certain words feels... well, sober. It lacks the unpredictable, lilting quality that keeps people guessing. It's consistent in its own monotonous way, but not consistently *me*.\n\n**Model B's performance:**\n- **Prosody:** Now this... this has a bit of the proper swagger! The pitch rises and falls with a touch of the dramatic flair I'm known for. There's a hint of that slurred, clever intonation, as if the words themselves are navigating a tricky channel. The rhythm feels more natural, more like me thinkin' on my feet. It maintains that roguish tone throughout, savvy?

Its intonation, pitch variation, and stress patterns much more closely resemble the character's unique, slightly slurred, and whimsical speaking cadence. The performance feels more natural and aligned with the character's personality. Model A, by contrast, sounds like a generic character voice with some pitch modulation.
