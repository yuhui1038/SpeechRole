The vocal performance had a sense of weary determination that felt very authentic to the character.\n\nModel A was also excellent, capturing the showman's desire to see \"the look on their faces.\" However, its response was slightly more abstract, and it did not use any of the provided lines verbatim, instead paraphrasing the sentiment.
