However, the vocal delivery was somewhat flat and robotic, and the response ended with a strange repetition of the last phrase, which was a significant technical flaw.\n\nModel B did not use a direct quote but instead crafted an original response that was perfectly in character for 郭靖, capturing his sincerity, his sense of duty, and his unwavering love for 黄蓉. The vocal performance was much more natural and expressive, sounding more like a person genuinely speaking the lines.\n\nOverall, while Model A followed the \"reuse lines\" instruction more literally, Model B delivered a more convincing and higher-quality performance as the character.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 9)",

However, it frames the situation as an ongoing dilemma, expressing a wish for the Khan to retract the engagement, rather than stating how it was ultimately resolved. Model B, while not using a direct quote, provides a more complete narrative. It explains the same emotional conflict but concludes by stating the final action taken—personally resigning from the engagement. This directly answers the \"how did you handle it?\" part of the question more thoroughly, presenting a logical and coherent resolution from a retrospective point of view. Both are coherent, but Model B's answer aligns better with the question's implication of a past, resolved event.\n\n[Scores]: (8, 9)",
