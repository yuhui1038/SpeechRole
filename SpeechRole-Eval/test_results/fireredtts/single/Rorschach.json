The voice has the correct gravelly, low, and somewhat flat tone that perfectly captures Rorschach's grim and detached personality. The emotional delivery is one of simmering, suppressed contempt rather than overt anger, which is highly appropriate for the character. The slow, deliberate pacing makes the iconic quoted lines feel all the more menacing and impactful. It sounds as if he's speaking his internal monologue aloud, perfectly aligning with his journal entries from the novel.\n\nModel B also provides a strong performance. The voice is suitably gruff and the contempt is audible. However, the emotional delivery is more of a straightforward, clipped anger. While this is a valid interpretation, it feels slightly less nuanced than Model A's portrayal. Rorschach's horror is often expressed through a cold, implacable judgment, and Model A's more subdued and chilling delivery captures this specific emotional state more accurately.\n\nBoth models are excellent, but Model Aâ€™s emotional appropriateness is a closer match to the source material.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 8)",

The opening \"Hmph\" is a very characteristic touch, immediately setting the right tone. Furthermore, ending with the iconic line, \"Never compromise.
