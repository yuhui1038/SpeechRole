It felt like a genuine monologue from the character. Model B was also very strong, adhering closely to the provided script and reusing original lines effectively, presenting a clear and direct narration from Salieri's perspective. While both were superb, Model A's more nuanced and emotional vocal performance gave it a slight edge in \"acting\" the part.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
