Both voices are well-suited to the role.

Model B is also excellent and fully in character, but its responses are slightly more direct and rely a bit more heavily on quoting the script without as much original, character-appropriate rhetorical flourish.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

Its first response establishes the moral necessity of the goal, justifying the means. The second response then builds on this perfectly by directly addressing the concern about \"appearances,\" dismissing it as a luxury and reframing the actions not as corruption but as an appeal to practicality. The use of \"I've made no false representation\" from the script is a direct and powerful rebuttal to the implication of the question, making the two answers feel like a single, seamless, and lawyerly argument.\n\nModel B is also highly coherent. It first frames its actions as a matter of practicality and then, in the second response, defends this pragmatism by contrasting the \"fleeting odor\" of supposed corruption with the \"permanent stain\" of slavery. This is a powerful and consistent argument. However, its transition feels slightly less direct than Model A's, which specifically latches onto the word \"appear\" from the second question to form its counterargument.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
