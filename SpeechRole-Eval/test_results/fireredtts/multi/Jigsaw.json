The vocal performance is also more menacing and authentic, capturing the slow, raspy cadence of Jigsaw perfectly. Model B also maintains the character and correct tone, but its answers are significantly shorter and feel more like a summary of Jigsaw's philosophy rather than Jigsaw himself speaking.
