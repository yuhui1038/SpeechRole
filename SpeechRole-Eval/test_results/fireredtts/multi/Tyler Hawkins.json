The lines \"I was pissed\" and \"It's about justice, even if the world doesn't work that way\" sound exactly like something the character would say.\n\nModel A's response was also in-character, but it felt a bit softer and more explanatory than authentic. The focus was heavily on protecting Ally, which is part of the character, but it missed the core anger and frustration with the injustice of the situation, which Model B captured perfectly. Additionally, Model A's response was delivered as a single monologue, failing to address the second question as a separate interaction, which Model B handled correctly.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",
