This grounding in specific plot points makes the progression feel very authentic and concrete. Model B's responses are more focused on Andrew's internal, psychological journeyâ€”from feeling like a \"punching bag\" to \"finally being seen.\" While also perfectly in-character, it's slightly more abstract.

While this might fit the introverted aspect of the character, it fails to capture the anger, the arrogance, and the emotional turmoil that define Andrew's journey.
