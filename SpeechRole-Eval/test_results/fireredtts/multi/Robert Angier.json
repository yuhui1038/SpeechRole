It flawlessly maintained the character of Robert Angier, consistently grounding its responses in the character's core motivations: his rivalry with Borden, his ambition, and the dark cost of his obsession. The language was sophisticated and perfectly captured Angier's theatrical and driven personality. Model A started well by using a direct quote, but its performance degraded significantly. The second response contained awkward, unnatural phrasing, and the third response devolved into complete nonsense, entirely breaking character and failing the core instruction.
