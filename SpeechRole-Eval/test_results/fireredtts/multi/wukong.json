Model A stood out by perfectly adhering to the instruction to reuse original lines from the novel. For the question about wanting to give up, it directly quoted the provided character script, which was a very effective and precise way to answer. Model B also gave strong, in-character answers, but it summarized Wukong's feelings rather than using the direct, raw lines from the book, making it slightly less adherent to that specific part of the prompt.
