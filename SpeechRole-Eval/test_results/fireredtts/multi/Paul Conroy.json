They both demonstrate a strong understanding of the character's knowledge, emotional state, and the specific plot points from the film.\n\nModel A delivers a slightly more visceral and raw performance. The vocal delivery is breathy, panicked, and effectively conveys the sheer terror and claustrophobia of the situation. Its first response, in particular, feels like a direct cry for help from inside the coffin, and the integration of lines from the script feels natural and impactful.\n\nModel B also gives a very strong performance, with excellent in-character writing. The line \"in this box... instructions are better than hope\" is particularly insightful and poignant. However, its delivery, while still desperate, feels marginally more narrative and less immediate than Model A's.\n\nOverall, both are excellent, but Model A's raw, panicked emotionality gives it a slight edge in its embodiment of the character.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

This grounding in the movie's specific events also created a very strong sense of coherence.\n\nBoth models are top-tier, but Model A's focus on the internal, emotional coherence felt slightly more immersive and less like a plot summary.
