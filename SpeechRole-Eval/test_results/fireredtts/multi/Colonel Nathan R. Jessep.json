It expertly captured Jessep's arrogance and dismissiveness, using lines that were either direct quotes or highly plausible improvisations. Model A's performance was also in character, but its dialogue felt more generic and less impactful. It seemed to paraphrase the character's sentiments rather than embody his specific voice, and some of the wording was a bit clunky, lacking the punch of the original character.\n\n[Scores]: (6, 10)",
