While both models correctly have Coriolanus dismiss the opinion of the people, Model B cleverly turns the user's logic on its head. It reframes his anger not as a political misstep, but as an act of integrity, arguing that suppressing it would be a \"betrayal of myself.\" This sophisticated justification demonstrates a slightly deeper grasp of Coriolanus's complex pride and self-conception, making the dialogue feel particularly authentic and coherent with his established character.

The pitch and pacing remain consistent with a powerful, commanding figure throughout both answers.\n\nModel B, while maintaining a consistent voice, fails to capture the character's prosodic signature. The delivery is much flatter and lacks the emotional intensity required for Coriolanus. The rage in the first response sounds muted and theatrical rather than genuine. The second response is similarly low-energy, sounding more petulant than proudly defiant.

Its second response, concluding that he would \"rather be banished for my truth than be Consul by their lie,\" is a perfect encapsulation of his tragic flaw.\n\nModel B is also exceptional, correctly identifying the core of Coriolanus's outrage and his dismissal of public opinion.
