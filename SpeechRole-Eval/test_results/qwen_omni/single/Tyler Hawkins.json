The shift in the response from \"Aidan's stupid idea\" to \"She's real. She makes me want to be better\" perfectly encapsulates Tyler's character arc regarding Ally.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, gives a very generic and repetitive answer. The constant repetition of \"I was just so used to being...\" feels robotic and unnatural, not like how a person, especially this specific character, would speak. While the themes mentioned (being lost, broken, alone) are relevant to the character, the delivery completely misses his voice and mannerisms.\n\n[Scores]: (3, 10)",
