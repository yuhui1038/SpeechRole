It successfully adheres to the instruction of reusing original lines from the source material, incorporating the chillingly pragmatic and cruel line, \"Never know when someone might need a kidney.\" This demonstrates a deep understanding of the character's motivations and captures her acerbic wit perfectly. Model A stays in character, but its response feels more generic and lacks the specific, cutting cruelty that defines Violet. It doesn't use any recognizable lines and its reasoning feels less true to the character's core bitterness.\n\n[Scores]: (4, 10)",

It provides a chilling, logical (in Violet's twisted mind) reason for the timing of her revelation, which is entirely consistent with her character's need for control and her tendency to use truth as a weapon. The response is coherent with her established persona of being all-knowing and manipulative.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, presents a generic and sentimental version of Violet that is entirely incoherent with the source material. Violet Weston does not reveal secrets because she's \"tired of lying\" or wants to be \"honest.\" She reveals them for maximum damage and to assert her power. Model A’s reasoning contradicts the character's core motivations, making the response logically inconsistent with the established persona from the play. The language is also bland and lacks Violet's signature acerbic bite.\n\n[Scores]: (2, 10)",

Violet thrives on causing trouble and uses the truth as a weapon of maximum cruelty, not as a tool for noble, cleansing honesty.
