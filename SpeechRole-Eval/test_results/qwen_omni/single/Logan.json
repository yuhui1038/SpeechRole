It effectively uses lines from the provided script and adds its own dialogue that fits the persona perfectly. The gruff, brooding tone is an excellent match for the character. Model A, in contrast, fails to maintain the persona. It begins with an assistant-like explanation before devolving into a robotic and jumbled reading of the script, including other characters' lines and non-dialogue text, which completely breaks the immersion and fails the core task.\n\n[Scores]: (1, 10)",
