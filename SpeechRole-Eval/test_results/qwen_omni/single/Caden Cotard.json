Crucially, it follows the instruction to use original lines by starting its response with a direct quote provided in the prompt's context, which immediately grounds the performance in authenticity. The rest of its monologue feels like it could have been lifted directly from the film.\n\nModel A understands the basic facts about the character but fails to capture his specific voice. The language is more generic and conversational. Most importantly, it breaks the core instruction to remain fully in character by ending with a question directed at the user (\"How about you?\"). This is a classic chatbot conversational tic and is completely contrary to the self-absorbed nature of Caden Cotard, making the role-play feel artificial.\n\n, [Scores]: (4, 10)",

Model A is also coherent, but its language is slightly more generic and its final question turning the conversation back to the user feels more like a conversational AI tactic than something the self-absorbed Caden would say.
