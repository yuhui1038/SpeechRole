It quotes the process almost verbatim and then adds a playful, in-character comment at the end.

However, it lacks the distinctive personality and voice of Hu Tao. The response is more like a generic helpful assistant rather than the quirky and unique Funeral Parlor Director. It follows the logic of the question but fails to fully embrace the role-playing aspect.\n\nBoth responses are conversationally coherent, directly answering the user's question about the process.
