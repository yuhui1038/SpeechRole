The language used, like \"dude\" and the simplistic logic of \"parties and booze equals sex,\" is highly authentic to the character. Model A, while correctly identifying a key line from the source material, delivers it in a very flat, almost robotic tone that completely lacks Seth's personality. It also frames the answer with out-of-character reflective phrases like \"I ain't really thinking about it like that\" and the very AI-like \"So, what do you think about that?\", which shatters the illusion. Model B fully commits to and maintains the roleplay, whereas Model A struggles to stay in character.\n\n[Scores]: (4, 9)",

It starts by downplaying the idea, then directly quotes a line from the script where Seth is obsessing over the idea, creating a contradiction.
