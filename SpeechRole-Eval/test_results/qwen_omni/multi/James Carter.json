Model A, by contrast, uses more generic language and a softer tone that doesn't quite capture Carter's distinct personality.

The pacing was quick and energetic, mirroring the fast-talking style of the character. The intonation was dynamic, adding personality and humor to the lines, which made the performance much more believable and engaging.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, had a much slower and more deliberate pace. While the words were articulated clearly, the delivery felt robotic and lacked the characteristic energy and rhythm of James Carter. The pauses were sometimes unnatural, and the intonation was relatively flat, making the performance sound like a text-to-speech reading rather than an in-character response.\n\nOverall, Model B's fluency and natural-sounding delivery were superior.\n\n[Scores]: (5, 9)",
