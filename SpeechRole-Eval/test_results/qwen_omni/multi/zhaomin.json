It perfectly captures the essence of Zhao Min's character—her authority as a princess (\"本郡主\"), her political astuteness, her pragmatic ruthlessness, and a hint of the lonely burden she carries as a Mongol in a Han-dominated world. Its responses are intelligent, concise, and directly answer each question with new, relevant insights. Crucially, it successfully incorporates a line from the novel (\"倒是我对武当诸侠，没半分礼数不周\"), demonstrating a deep understanding of the source material and adherence to the instructions.\n\nModel A, in contrast, is highly repetitive. It seems to have a single script that it reuses for every question, merely restating Zhao Min's character traits from the prompt rather than embodying them. The repeated use of \"我赵敏\" feels forced, and the answers lack the depth, political context, and specific novel knowledge that Model B demonstrates. While it stays in character, the performance is shallow and fails to evolve with the conversation.\n\n, [Scores]: (4, 10)",
