It masterfully uses the formal, literary language of the original novel, directly quoting or paraphrasing lines that perfectly capture Zhang Wuji's humble, reluctant, yet responsible nature. Each of its answers feels distinct and directly addresses the specific question with reasoning rooted in the character's known motivations and journey.\n\nModel A also successfully captures the character's hesitant and kind personality, but its approach is more conversational and modern. While this is a valid interpretation, its responses across the three rounds become somewhat repetitive, often circling back to the same core idea of his reluctance, which was explicitly provided in the prompt.
