More importantly, it gets a key plot point wrong by claiming it figured out the Shaolin techniques on its own, contradicting the novel where Jiumozhi explicitly states he received the manuals from Murong Bo. This shows a poor grasp of the character's knowledge and history.\n\nModel B is excellent. It perfectly captures Jiumozhi's duplicitous nature—outwardly polite and scholarly (\"小僧,\" \"得蒙先生,\" \"铭感于心\") while harboring great ambition. It correctly references the plot by acknowledging that the manuals were a gift from Murong Bo, even paraphrasing lines from the novel. The tone, vocabulary, and adherence to the character's established persona are flawless.\n\n, [Scores]: (3, 10)",

Worse, it gets stuck in a loop, repeating this same false statement in response to all three distinct questions, failing to engage with the user's prompts meaningfully.
