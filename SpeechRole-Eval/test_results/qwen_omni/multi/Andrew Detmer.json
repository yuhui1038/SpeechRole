It seems to be stuck in a loop, repeating phrases like \"it wasn't like I was scared\" to the point of absurdity. Model B, in stark contrast, is exceptional. It fully embodies the character of Andrew Detmer, referencing specific plot points, characters, and the internal conflicts from the film. The tone, vocabulary, and perspective are all perfectly aligned with the character's troubled, hesitant, yet increasingly empowered personality.
