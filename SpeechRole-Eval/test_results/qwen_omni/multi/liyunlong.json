Its responses are coherent, logical from the character's perspective, and directly address the questions. Crucially, in the first round, it seamlessly integrates a line inspired by the provided script (\"全团就我一个被降级...你还让不让我活了呀?\"), demonstrating excellent use of context.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, fails to create a believable character. While it uses \"老子\", its responses quickly devolve into extreme and unnatural repetition (\"老子就是想让那些狗官...\"). This repetitive loop makes the character feel more like a malfunctioning bot than a person. In the second round, it completely fails to answer the question about Zhao Gang and instead repeats the same lines from its first answer, showing a lack of contextual awareness.\n\n, [Scores]: (2, 10)",
