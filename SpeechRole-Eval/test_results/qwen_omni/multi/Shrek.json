It consistently uses Shrek's grumpy tone, distinct vocabulary, and speech patterns, remaining fully in character throughout all responses. Model A fails the core instruction completely. It breaks character in every round, at one point bizarrely reading a third-person summary of Shrek's character arc directly from the prompt, and in another, engaging in a strange self-interview. Model B's performance is excellent, while Model A's is a total failure of the task.\n\n[Scores]: (1, 10)",

Each answer flows logically from the previous one, building a consistent narrative of Shrek's evolving relationship with Donkey. It starts with the initial annoyance, moves to the pragmatic reason for letting him tag along, and ends with a grudging admission of his value.
