The vocabulary is elevated and perfectly suited to a thousand-year-old immortal, and the reasoning behind his actions aligns flawlessly with his motivations in the series. Model A, in stark contrast, fails to grasp the character's essence. Its language is overly simplistic, repetitive, and modern, with the constant use of \"you know\" feeling completely out of place.

Its responses are highly repetitive, both within a single answer and across the two rounds. The second response fails to meaningfully address the new question about justification, instead just repeating the basic desire to have Davina on its side.
