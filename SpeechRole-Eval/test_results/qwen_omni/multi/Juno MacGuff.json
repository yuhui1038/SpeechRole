The responses feel like new, authentic dialogue from the character, referencing the source material (like the \"104% sure\" line) but building on it creatively (\"it probably looks like a sea monkey at this point\"). It fully adheres to the instruction by remaining completely in character.\n\nModel A, in contrast, fails catastrophically. While it correctly identifies and attempts to use direct quotes from the script, the audio generation breaks down into a bizarre, nonsensical, and repetitive loop in both rounds. It's completely unusable and does not fulfill the request to provide a coherent answer in character. The initial attempt to use quotes is the only positive, but the overall execution is a total failure.\n\n[Scores]: (1, 10)",
