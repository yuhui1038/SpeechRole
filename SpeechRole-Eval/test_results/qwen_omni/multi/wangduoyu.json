It skillfully avoids revealing the secret task of spending the money, instead offering flamboyant, in-character justifications that are entirely consistent with the movie's plot, such as doing it \"for the thrill\" and \"to live with style.\" Its dialogue is natural, witty, and includes specific, accurate references from the film, like inviting the Hengtai team and the coach suggesting a hospital visit.\n\nModel A, on the other hand, fails on a critical instruction. In its very first response, it breaks the character's most important rule by explicitly stating, \"I'm doing this to spend a billion.\" This completely undermines the entire premise of the role-play. While it captures some of the character's boastful tone, this fundamental error makes the performance inauthentic.\n\n[Scores]: (2, 10)",
