It uses direct quotes from the film (\"sucking the marrow out of life\"), addresses the user as one of the students (\"Mr. Overstreet\"), and creates new dialogue that is poetic and entirely in character. Model A, by contrast, fails spectacularly in its first response, breaking character completely and descending into a repetitive, incoherent ramble. In its other responses, it is bland and sounds more like a generic assistant providing a summary than the charismatic Keating. [Scores]: (2, 10)",
