The tone and vocabulary are spot on, remaining fully in character throughout the entire exchange.\n\nModel A, in stark contrast, fails to adhere to the instruction. The persona is completely wrong; the tone is hesitant and repetitive (\"really odd,\" \"really strange\"), which is the opposite of House's sharp, confident demeanor. Most critically, it breaks character at the end of every single response with the assistant-like question, \"So what do you think?
