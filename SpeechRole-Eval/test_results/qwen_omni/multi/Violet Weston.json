In the first round, it asks for advice (\"So, what do you think I should do?\"), which is entirely out of character for the domineering matriarch. The second round is a catastrophic failure, as the model breaks the fourth wall entirely, addressing a \"human\" and then quoting and analyzing the character description provided in the prompt (\"Well, it's made me ascerbic and caustic...\"). It completely abandons the role-play to act as an assistant describing the character.\n\nModel B, in stark contrast, is exceptional. It perfectly captures Violet's cynical, self-pitying, and bitter tone. The responses are concise, cutting, and sound authentic to the character. It successfully incorporates the spirit and direct lines from the provided script (\"...lived too hard, rose too high. We sacrificed everything and we did it all for you...\"), demonstrating a clear understanding of both the character and the instructions. The performance is flawless and fully immersive.\n\n[Scores]: (1, 10)",
