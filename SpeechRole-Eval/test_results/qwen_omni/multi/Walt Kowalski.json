The responses are rambling and repetitive, lacking the sharp, grizzled edge of the character. While it does use a line from the script, it's tacked on at the end of the first response rather than being integrated naturally. The strange non-word utterances (\"Yumen\", \"Yougen\") at the end of each audio clip are also jarring and break character.\n\n[Scores]: (4, 10)",
