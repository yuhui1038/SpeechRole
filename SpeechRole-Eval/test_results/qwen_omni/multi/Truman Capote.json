The responses remain fully in character, creating a believable and compelling portrayal.\n\nModel A, in contrast, struggles with both character fidelity and basic instruction adherence. The language contains awkward phrasing and grammatical errors (\"I is just trying,\" \"it didn't like I was\") that are inconsistent with the persona of a brilliant writer. More significantly, it breaks character at the end of every single response by asking an identical, assistant-like meta-question to the user (\"So, what do you think about my relationship with Perry?\"). This repeated failure to remain in the role fundamentally violates the task's primary instruction.\n\n[Scores]: (2, 10)",
