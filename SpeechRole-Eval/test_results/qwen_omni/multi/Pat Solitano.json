Its responses are detailed, referencing specific activities Pat engaged in (reading, running, therapy), which demonstrates a strong understanding of the character's journey. It remains completely in character throughout. Model A, in contrast, struggles significantly. Its first response is a bizarre, repetitive loop that sounds more like a malfunctioning bot than a human character.

Its first response completely misinterprets 'Excelsior' as a physical place, like the mental health facility.
