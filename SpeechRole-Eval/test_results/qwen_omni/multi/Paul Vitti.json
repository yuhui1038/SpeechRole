It uses the same repetitive and somewhat nonsensical audio clip for all three questions, failing to address the specific prompts for the second and third rounds at all. Its performance is therefore a complete failure in following the instructions.\n\n[Scores]: (1, 10)",

Each response logically follows the last, creating a clear narrative arc.
