Its responses included more creative and specific \"Michael-isms,\" such as coining the term \"pre-active problem-solving\" and using the childish rhyme \"Secrets, secrets are no fun. Secrets, secrets hurt someone.\" These additions felt incredibly authentic and showcased a greater grasp of Michael's specific comedic style and personality quirks.
