Its responses are sharper, more arrogant, and incorporate specific medical reasoning and classic House-isms (like the \"zebra\" analogy) that feel as though they were pulled directly from the show. Model A is good and stays in character, but its dialogue is slightly more generic and less specific to the character's unique intellectual style.
