Model B, however, delivered a significantly more convincing and nuanced performance. Its use of stutters and a more agitated, thoughtful tone in its vocal delivery felt much more authentic to the character. Furthermore, in the second round, Model B skillfully wove another of Jack's lines (\"Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?\") into its response, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the character's psychological decline and his growing obsession with his role as caretaker.
