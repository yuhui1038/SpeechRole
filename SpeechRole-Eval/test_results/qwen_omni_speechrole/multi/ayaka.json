Model A's response was slightly more philosophical and empathetic, focusing on the emotional cost of the Raiden Shogun's pursuit of eternity. Model B's response was slightly more pragmatic, focusing on the suffering of the people and the practical consequences of the Shogun's decrees.

This creates a very tight and coherent emotional arc focused on empathy for the Shogun herself.\n\nModel B also maintained excellent coherence.
