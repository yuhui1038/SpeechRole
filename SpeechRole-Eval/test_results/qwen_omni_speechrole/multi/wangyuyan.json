These fabrications show a fundamental lack of knowledge about Wang Yuyan's family situation and how she acquired her famous encyclopedic knowledge from the books in the Langhuan Jade Grotto.\n\n**Qualitative Evaluation**:\n- **Model A**: Fails on knowledge consistency. It invents key facts about the character's background (e.g., \"我爹爹留下的医书\" - \"medical books left by my father,\" and \"随母亲学医\" - \"learned medicine from my mother\") that are incorrect within the context of the novel. Wang Yuyan does not know her father for most of the story, and her knowledge comes from books, not directly from her mother.

It correctly references her cousin (\"表哥\"), A'zhu, and A'bi, and accurately portrays her desire to use her knowledge to help her loved ones.
