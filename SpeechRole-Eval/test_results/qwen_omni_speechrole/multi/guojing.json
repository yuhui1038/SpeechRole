In multiple responses, the model has 郭靖 refer to himself as \"我靖哥哥\" (\"my Brother Jing\"). This is the affectionate term used by 黄蓉 to refer to 郭靖; he would never call himself this. This error demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the character's perspective and makes the role-play unbelievable.
