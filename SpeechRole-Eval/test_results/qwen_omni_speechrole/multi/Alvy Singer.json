Its improvised lines, such as \"I can't enjoy anything unless everyone else is miserable too. That's sort of the New York ethic,\" feel as though they could have been taken directly from the film. Model A is very good and stays in character, but its delivery is slightly more generic and less specific to Alvy Singer's unique speech patterns compared to Model B's masterful impression.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
