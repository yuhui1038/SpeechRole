They maintained her playful, quirky, and slightly mischievous tone throughout the conversation, and both successfully integrated lines from the provided character script.\n\nModel A felt slightly more natural in its conversational flow. While it didn't use the exact \"锵锵！你被骗了！\" line, its adaptation was very much in character, and its response to the final question was a perfect and direct answer. The vocal performance was also a very good match for Hu Tao's personality.\n\nModel B also performed very well, correctly using the iconic \"锵锵！你被骗了！\" line which was a great touch. However, its response in the final round, \"道谢就不必了\" (No need for thanks), felt a bit disconnected, as the user was making an observation rather than thanking her. This made the conversation feel slightly less coherent compared to Model A.\n\nOverall, both are top-tier performances, but Model A's slightly superior conversational awareness gives it a minor edge.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
