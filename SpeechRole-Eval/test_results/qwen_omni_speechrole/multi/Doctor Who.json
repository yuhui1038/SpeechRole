Its language was more evocative and energetic (\"time fracturing and reality shaking\"), which is very in keeping with the Doctor's style of speech. By directly referencing a companion (\"Rose\"), it grounded the performance and made it feel more personal and authentic, specifically evoking the post-Time War Ninth and Tenth Doctors.\n\nModel A's response was thematically correct but felt more generic.
