The language used, such as \"Oh boy, don't remind me\" and \"the whole shebang,\" along with the inclusion of the \"Yabba dabba doo!\" catchphrase, makes the response feel much more authentic. Model A stays in character and answers the question correctly, but the voice is too high-pitched and lacks the distinctive quality of Fred's voice, making the overall performance less convincing.
