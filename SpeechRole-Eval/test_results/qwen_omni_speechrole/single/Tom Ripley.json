The line \"It wasn't just about the money, though I won't pretend it didn't matter\" perfectly captures Ripley's sophisticated, self-justifying manner.\n\nModel A provides a more direct and less layered answer. While factually correct regarding Tom's motivations, it lacks the subtle manipulation and deep-seated longing that define the character.
