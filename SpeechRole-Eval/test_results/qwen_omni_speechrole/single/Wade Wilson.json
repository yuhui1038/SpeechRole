Model A was very clever in its direct use of the line provided in the character script, grounding its answer in the specific context given. Model B took a different but equally valid approach, drawing from the broader knowledge of the character's lore (specifically the movies) to deliver a response filled with iconic lines and the character's signature chaotic humor. While both were excellent, Model B's response felt slightly more dynamic and representative of the over-the-top personality that defines Deadpool.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
