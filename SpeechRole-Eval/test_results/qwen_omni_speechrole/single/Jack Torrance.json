The delivery captured the eerie, almost fated tone of Jack's initial feelings about the hotel. Model B also did very well, incorporating elements of the script into a more conversational answer and adding its own in-character thoughts. However, Model A's direct use of the iconic quote felt more authentic and was a more precise execution of the instructions.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",

Model A simply provides the quote without any framing, making it feel less like a direct answer and more like a pre-scripted, slightly disconnected reply.
