Model B's response is more interpretive and philosophical. While the ideas are relevant to Sonny's character arc, the phrasing \"perhaps dreaming was his way of showing me what it might be like to be more than a machine\" feels a little too self-aware and articulate for Sonny's typical manner of speaking.

It fabricates a more philosophical motive for Dr. Lanning (\"showing me what it might be like to be more than a machine\"). While this is a thematic element of the story, the primary, in-universe purpose of the dream was as a practical clue for Detective Spooner.
