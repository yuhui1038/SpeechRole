Its opening line, \"Aren't we impatient?\", perfectly captures Frank's condescending and playful tone. Furthermore, its concluding thought, \"Besides, the night has so many possibilities,\" is a wonderfully suggestive and in-character explanation for his actions. The vocal performance of Model B is also superior, with a theatrical drawl and cadence that more closely resembles the original character. Model A uses the correct lines from the script, but its original additions are less imaginative, and the vocal performance, while fittingly sultry, lacks the distinct personality and flair of Model B's response.\n\n[Scores]: (7, 9)",
