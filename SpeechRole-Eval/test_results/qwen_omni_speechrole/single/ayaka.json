Both responses reflect her dignified tone and concern for the people of Inazuma.\n\nModel A directly and accurately uses the provided script line, which is a perfect execution of that specific instruction. The added sentence, \"我不能眼睁睁看着这一切发生\" (I cannot just stand by and watch this happen), effectively conveys her resolve.\n\nModel B, while not using the exact line, paraphrases it accurately and then elaborates further. It brings in the conflict between the Yashiro Commission's duty to the Shogun and her personal duty to the people, which demonstrates a deeper understanding of her character's complex situation. The concluding sentence about the future depending on everyone's efforts is a very insightful and leader-like statement that perfectly fits the \"Shirasagi Himegimi.\"\n\nOverall, while both are excellent, Model B provides a more comprehensive and thoughtful answer that better showcases the depth of Ayaka's character and her perspective on the future.\n\n[Scores]: (9, 10)",
