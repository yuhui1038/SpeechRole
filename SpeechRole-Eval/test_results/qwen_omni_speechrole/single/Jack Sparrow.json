The voice actor for Model B adopted a gruff, slightly slurred, and swaggering tone that was highly evocative of the character, Jack Sparrow. The pacing and delivery felt much more authentic. In contrast, Model A used a female voice, which was immediately jarring and inconsistent with the requested character. While the script for Model A was adequate, Model B's vocal performance was far superior and created a much more immersive and believable portrayal.\n\n[Scores]: (5, 9)",
