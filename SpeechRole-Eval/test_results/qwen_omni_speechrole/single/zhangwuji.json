This demonstrates a strong understanding of the source material and the character's key moments of realization. The response is precise and directly reflects a pivotal scene.\n\nModel B also delivers an excellent in-character response. While not a direct quote, it perfectly synthesizes Zhang Wuji's personality and motivations. It explicitly states his lack of personal ambition (\"绝无称霸之念\") and his true goal of helping his brothers and restoring the nation, which is entirely consistent with his character arc.\n\nBoth performances are top-tier in terms of instruction adherence. Model A's use of a direct quote is a very literal and effective way to fulfill the prompt, while Model B's original, yet perfectly in-character, response is equally impressive. They are equally successful in maintaining the persona.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 10)",

It is accurate and coherent, explaining the true meaning of the famous saying.\n\nModel B, while also referencing the same core idea, frames its response more as a direct, personal answer to the question. It explicitly denies any ambition for personal power (\"绝无称霸之念\") and clearly states his selfless goal of using the knowledge to help his people and reclaim their land. This direct address makes the dialogue feel more natural and personal, thus demonstrating slightly better conversational coherence by directly engaging with the user's query about his personal feelings (\"心中可曾有\").\n\n, [Scores]: (9, 10)",
