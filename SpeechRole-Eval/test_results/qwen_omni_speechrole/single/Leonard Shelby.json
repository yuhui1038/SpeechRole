They both successfully adopted his fragmented, fact-based way of thinking and speaking.\n\nModel A's performance was particularly strong, capturing the raw, desperate anger of the character. The line, \"I can't remember, but I know,\" perfectly encapsulates Leonard's core conflict, and finishing with the direct quote from the film, \"I found you, you fuck,\" was a powerful and authentic choice that directly addressed the certainty in the question.\n\nModel B was also excellent, focusing more on the methodical, process-driven side of Leonard's personality. The delivery, with slight hesitations like \"His John... that's what my notes... say,\" effectively portrayed someone trying to read and trust their own system. The line, \"I don't go by memories. They're unreliable,\" is a fantastic, in-character statement.\n\nOverall, both were superb, but Model A's inclusion of the character's emotional state in addition to his logical process gave it a slight edge in its portrayal.\n\n[Scores]: (10, 9)",
